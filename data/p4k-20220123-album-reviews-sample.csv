0,GLOW,['patten'],"Working with a stripped-down palette of synthesizers and almost no drums, the UK producer reconnects with the fundamental sense of strangeness that runs through his best music.
One unforeseen side effect of the pandemic is that our collective sense of time has been thrown out of whack. The arrow of our days no longer flies true; it moves more like a crinkled paper plane—soaring briefly, plunging without notice, skidding gracelessly sideways across the floor. Sometimes it seems almost to loop backward. The London producer patten’s GLOW, recorded entirely during the UK’s lockdown, is propelled by this elastic timekeeping and steeped in the uneasy mood of the day. Created using a relatively stripped-down palette of synthesizers, it features almost no drums but could not quite be called ambient. It is restless in places and directionless in others; the mood is emotionally numb, except when it is sullen. Sometimes it is even a little boring, but not in an unpleasant way. Like a ticking clock in a quiet room, its blankness is the sort that leads the mind to wander. And the chance to wander, these days, is to be prized.
The absence of beats marks a notable shift for patten. On early albums like 2011’s GLAQJO XAACSSO and 2014’s ESTOILE NAIANT, which kicked off a brief tenure on Warp, he harnessed a welter of hyper-compressed, low-bitrate sounds and squished them into a lumpy sort of beat music: Imagine a fistful of lossy YouTube rips fed through a Play-Doh noodle maker. Last year’s Flex took a step away from the psychedelic murk of those albums, incorporating the icy clarity of trap and grime along with some of the brawn of breakbeat-driven bass music. The results often sounded less original—and less interesting—than his foundational work. But with GLOW, patten reconnects with the fundamental sense of strangeness that has run through his best music, even without the tangled rhythms and messy textures that once were his stock in trade.
On most of GLOW’s 14 tracks, patten plays his cards close to his chest. Each song is made up of a slim handful of moving parts that tend to spin slowly and aimlessly in place; loops trundle along in parallel, patterns stumbling almost imperceptibly. These sequences and arpeggios sound less like impeccably executed digital commands than the product of fingers idly drumming against the keys, the musician half-asleep in the studio chair, deep into the small hours of the night. There are no big emotional payoffs; most tracks just play out until they don’t anymore. In “Clandestine Modal,” distortion gradually creeps across an expanse of airy synths, covering them in fuzz, like mold consuming a piece of fruit. “Screen Burn,” mostly just heavy pads and buzzing FM bass, spins like a leaden mobile in thick, humid air. “Rorschach” suggests the theme from The Exorcist played on kalimba and run through dub delay, underscoring the anxious, horror-film mood that lies just below the album’s surface.
Many of these pieces could work well as film cues. That goes equally for the simplest tracks—like the dissonant “Chronoblur,” its reverb as opaque as a frosted window—and the few that are more complex. “Memory Palace” unfolds with a particularly gratifying unpredictability, playing a garbled guitar melody off fluorescent-tube hum, like Oneohtrix Point Never remixing the Cure’s Pornography. “Valley Commerce” is even better. Over plodding, minor-key piano and soft horns, a palm-muted guitar rhythm rises in the mix, triggering unexpected memories of ’90s alt rock. It’s an attention-grabbing climax on an album that mostly keeps drama at arm’s length.
Despite patten’s description of the record as an album with “no beats,” the faintest outline of a drum pattern appears on the penultimate track, “Lariat,” where rigid eighth-note taps click insistently against a gelatinous synth figure, as though determined to rein it in. Behind that, a fragment of what sounds like voice is spun backwards and forward, over and over, suggesting a bored filmmaker slumped over the edit bay, toggling a snippet of video back and forth. It’s an effective encapsulation of GLOW’s entire outlook: stuck in place, marking time, and stolidly waiting—for what, exactly, nobody quite knows.

1,Finds You Well,['Khotin'],"On an album blending downtempo beats and ambient textures, many of the strongest moments skew toward the Canadian producer’s softer side, with slight arrangements that meditate on a single mood.
For Dylan Khotin-Foote, house music has long been a vehicle for careful studies of ambient tone and texture. On his 2014 debut album, Hello World, the Canadian producer used hardware synths and drum machines to craft muted compositions that traded the bleary-eyed psychedelia of the Orb and the KLF for a playful impressionism with little interest in historical continuity. The album became a touchstone for a generation of lo-fi house producers who slathered their recordings with reverb and tape hiss. Unlike many of his peers, Khotin mostly abandoned the kick drum, honing his focus on vivid soundscapes with albums like New Tab and Beautiful You. Finds You Well, his first album under the alias in two years, pairs his skill as an ambient musician with a newfound interest in spacious downtempo production, expanding the scope of the project without compromising what made his earlier work so special.
Like his early experiments with house music, Khotin’s use of warped and pitch-shifted breakbeats serves mostly to complement his foundation in ambient composition. Tracks like “Ivory Tower” and “Heavyball” feature breezy melodies and coarse drums loops in equal parts, building intricate collages that feel intentional in new ways. With its dial-tone arpeggios and warbling tape-deck stutter, “WEM Lagoon Jump” invites comparisons to ’90s IDM icons Boards of Canada, finding a soothing equanimity in the rolling current of its effect-ridden snares. Beyond their immediate rhythmic similarities, the two acts share an affinity for wistful samples and field recordings; “Groove 32” explores the percussive potential of short vocal clips doused in radio static, while “Outside in the Light” turns distant voicemails from family members into something warm and dreamlike.
As much as the album benefits from a renewed interest in rhythm, many of its strongest moments skew toward the softer side of the producer’s palette, with slight arrangements that meditate on a single mood. On “Lucky Egg,” a steady loop of pitched toms and synth pads blooms into a poignant snapshot of a snowy landscape, as a single crystalline keyboard floats like lens flare across its surface. The shortest track on the album, as well as one of its sparsest, it sets the tone for a stretch of delicate compositions that wring heartbreak from the upright piano. “Your Favorite Building” calls to mind the rosy miniatures of Blithe Field and Ricky Eat Acid at their most affecting; like these contemporaries, Khotin seems content to set a few well-placed elements in motion, stepping back to watch their smoldering glow from a distance instead of fidgeting with any single detail up close.
In its final moments, the album recedes even further into heartfelt solitude. With little more than a few skeletal piano chords struck at distant intervals, “Shopping List” finds a sublime beauty in the near-silent space between tones, sculpting excess reverb into a wintery jetstream that might otherwise be categorized as background noise. Less about the sound itself than the strategic use of its absence, it’s a moment that might go unnoticed on another record, but one that feels like a transformative reset in Khotin’s hands. What might sound ordinary in isolation can feel transcendent with the right frame of reference, and as Finds You Well shows, sometimes it’s the smallest details that can reshape your entire perspective.",2020-09-26T05:00:00,['Electronic'],7.2,Ghostly International,Khotin: Finds You Well Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khotin-finds-you-well/,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2020-09-26,8.987671232876712,2020.5,0.0
2,Rings Around the World,['Super Furry Animals'],"To date, the Super Furry Animals have driven a blue, techno-blaring tank to gigs before selling it to Don Henley ...
To date, the Super Furry Animals have driven a blue, techno-blaring tank to gigs before selling it to Don Henley, broken the record for saying ""fuck"" in a charting, Steely Dan-sampling pop single, constructed a Macy's Day-sized balloon of a soda-slurping raccoon, subjected themselves to alien abduction in an ILM-created music video, recorded the highest-selling Welsh-language album ever, and remixed the Beatles for a Grammy-nominated record. To say the least, they've kept audiences on their toes with their audacity and playfulness.
It would seem that there's little left for SFA to accomplish, except for those ever-elusive multiplatinum worldwide sales. Rings Around the World aims for that and beyond. Not only do members of the Velvet Underground and the Beatles offhandedly appear on the record (completely inconspicuously), but Rings Around the World will be the first album ever to see debut release on DVD complete with 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound, videos for each song directed by Dogme directors, cartoonists, and underground radicals, and track-by-track remixes by the likes of Matmos, Kid 606, and Brave Captain. The project sounds ambitious and brilliant on paper, but it's nothing without the music to back it up. No fear, as SFA have pulled out their entire catalog of styles and whipped up their best album to date-- a bold claim to the upper echelon of rock.
On the whole, Rings Around the World infuses 1970s soul, sunshine, and sparkle to more familiar Furries territory. Philly horns and strings seep from ""It's Not the End of the World,"" ""Presidential Suite,"" and the first single, ""Juxtaposed with U."" Like their past single, ""Northern Lights,"" ""Juxtaposed"" comes across more as a genre exercise-- this time favoring AM soul over tropicalia-- but flips the song with vocoder verses and a rollerskate-handclap chorus refrain of, ""You've got to tolerate all those people that you hate/ I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you."" Singer Gruff Rhys claims that Bobby Brown turned down an invitation to duet on the ""let's get juxtaposed"" lines, but the song remains subversively genius, nonetheless. If older singles, such as ""Demons"" off Radiator, modernized Bowie's Space Oddity, than ""Juxtaposed"" is clearly the heir to ""Young Americans"" and ""Fame.""
""Run, Christian, Run!"" gallops into late-era Byrds territory, with steel guitars and modified twang, though thematically, the lyrics run the exact opposite of Sad Sweetheart's ""The Christian Life."" Mellow acoustic strumming and thick harmonies of lines like ""you deserve to die"" give way to manic breakbeats on the breath-taking ""No Sympathy,"" perhaps the first pop song ever to fuse idyllic folk with IDM, not counting SFA's own ""Mountain People,"" which fused idyllic folk with house.
Surprisingly, though Rings stands as the Super Furry Animals' boldest pop album yet, few songs reach into rocking territory. The heaviest moments pop up in the first third of the record, after the somnambulist stomp of the opener. ""Sidewalk Serfer Girl"" splices metal riffing with skittering electronics and the ever-present Huge Chorus, and the title track takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details. Rhys growls in the speaker-blowing outro to the otherwise cheery ""Receptacle for the Respectable.""
The music is paisley, sun-heated, and layered, and juxtaposed to Rhys' satirical and heartfelt lyrics, the result is timeless. Just reading the song titles gives one the sense of humor and rancor that courses through the record. As mentioned before, it's impossible to deny Bowie's muse in SFA's career, despite their continued costuming in anoraks and cargo pants instead of red mullets, white scarves, spandex and suits. The chameleon act is left to the tunes. More conveniently, SFA will butt a ""Let's Dance"" up against a ""Black Country Rock"" or ""Speed of Life"" on the same album side, all while maintaining a rustic, inherently Welsh vibe. Princess Di, ""Princess of Wales,"" never set foot inside the country, and karma caught up. Heed the warning and dive in.",2001-07-23T06:01:40,['Rock'],8.9,Epic,Super Furry Animals: Rings Around the World Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7598-rings-around-the-world/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2001-07-23,-10.204109589041096,2001.5,0.0
3,The Devil You Know,['The Coathangers'],"The punk trio’s unfussy production and precise vocal harmonies are a testament to their well-earned longevity.
When the Coathangers played their first show at an Atlanta house party in 2006, they could barely play their instruments. What began as an excuse to get rowdy with friends quickly evolved into a self-titled debut album with lawless, skull-smashing potency.  Thirteen years later, the Coathangers have developed their riotous, lo-fi early work into a more harmonious sound without losing their spiritual connection to the unprocessed simplicity and belligerence of their chaotic origin story. Sixth studio album The Devil You Know is a collection of glorious cassette-tape jams with unfussy production, tight melodies, and precise vocal harmonies. It fits together as easily as a toddler’s jigsaw puzzle.
On ""Bimbo,"" a peppy guitar riff and drum loop bop along under the sweet-toned vocal stylings of guitarist Julia Kugel. The song then shifts into more jagged riffs to support drummer Stephanie Luke’s throaty garbles. The vocal interplay is a hallmark of the Coathangers’ sound, and their instincts when wielding it are near flawless.
A good Coathangers song proves that slick arrangements can facilitate blunt messages. Substance abuse has regularly punctuated their lyrics: ""Adderall,"" a desperate ode to prescription-drug dependency from 2014’s Suck My Shirt, stands as one of their best songs. The new album’s “Step Back” offers a quieter but doomed depiction of the pain and helplessness of addiction. Over scratchy guitar chords and Meredith Franco’s bassline, Kugel reaches out to a loved one in crisis: “You’ve been gone too long,” she sings, “and I want you back.” Her fragile performance at first seems like a soothing anecdote—dissolution of the human spirit never sounded so desirable. Yet when Kugel hits the ethereal “ooooohs” on the song’s hook, her tenderness dissolves, as though the addict has finally slipped out of the arms of care.
The album’s melodic strengths can occasionally become a weakness, and at times a little more of that early rawness would have been appropriate. The creeping ""Stranger Danger,"" for instance, could have used some extra muck on Franco’s bass to punctuate its horror-movie flavor. But this rare sense of caution can’t collapse a well-formed set that ratifies the band’s unflinching code of ethics. When asked to rank the group’s previous albums by Noisey last year, Kugel ranked them in reverse order. On The Devil You Know, their evolution continues.",2019-03-20T05:00:00,['Rock'],7.6,Suicide Squeeze,The Coathangers: The Devil You Know Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-coathangers-the-devil-you-know/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2019-03-20,7.464383561643835,2019.0,0.0
4,Flower of Evil,['Susanna'],"Susanna (sans her Magical Orchestra) tackles another slate of cover songs comprising unlikely selections from Tom Petty, Thin Lizzy, ABBA, and more. Will Oldham duets on several tracks, including a version of his Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy song ""Joy and Jubilee"".
There's a certain amount of hubris inherent in every covers record. Surely many if not most begin quite innocently, like a fan letter to a favorite act. But the implication is still that the singer or band thinks that they can bring something new to someone else's song or performance. Perhaps they feel that they can even make the song better. The fact that this rarely happens apparently deters no one. ""Playing covers... is not the same as, say, recording your favorite songs of all time,"" elaborated Norwegian singer Susanna Wallumrod when an interviewer from The Guardian asked about her propensity toward re-imagining the songs of others. ""That wouldn't be interesting. It is about trying to make good music of your own.""
Truth be told, Susanna's strategy to date has largely been about making someone else's good music her own. Susanna and the Magical Orchestra's first album, 2004's List of Lights and Buoys, featured a couple of covers, including a morphine-slow take on Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"". But 2006's Melody Mountain was comprised of nothing but covers, including such ringers as ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the umpteenth recording of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"". These less adventurous selections were offered along with more eclectic stabs at the likes of AC/DC, Prince, and, um, KISS. And 1980s KISS, no less (though if you want to pick a song to make better, you couldn't do much better-- which is to say worse-- than ""Crazy, Crazy Nights"").
In 2007, Wallumrod-- sans former Jaga Jazzist keyboardist Morten Qvenild, aka the Magical Orchestra-- emerged with the album of originals Sonata Mix Dwarf Cosmos. But she's back to her old tricks with her second solo disc Flower of Evil, another collection of radically rearranged covers. Well, mostly covers. Susanna slips a couple of originals onto this disc, too, but ""Goodbye"" and ""Wild Is the Will"" tend to blend right in, so thoroughly does Susanna adapt each chosen song to her particularly despondent milieu of dramatic piano and spare accompaniment by pals Helge Sten and Pål Hausken.
Frankly, it's hard to tell what we're meant to take away from Wallumrod's introductory take on Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak"", no matter how heartbreaking she makes it, especially when she's backed by the master of malleable sincerity himself, Mr. Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. Will Oldham turns up again later as duet partner on Badfinger's ""Without You"", and his own ""Joy and Jubilee"" gets the Susanna treatment, too. It's a great fit, brittle and beautiful in all the right places, getting to the heart of Oldham's song in a way that the elusive songwriter himself sometimes disallows.
A few other tracks prove apt fits as well, particularly Sandy Denny's ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"", Roy Harper's ""Forever"", and Nico's ""Janitor of Lunacy"", songs you'd think couldn't get any more melancholy or morose...until they do. Black Sabbath's ballad ""Changes"" especially benefits from its new setting, not to mention Susanna's female touch, as does Tom Petty's ""Don't Come Around Here No More"", plucked from its 80s trappings and remade as a funereal hymn. Fresh readings of Prince's forgotten Lovesexy track ""Dance On"" and ABBA's ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" highlight the strength of lyrics too often subsumed by each respective original song's ace production, even if in the latter case, the original Eurodisco trumps Susanna's Eurodirge.
Yet whether you're Chan Marshall, Mark Kozelek, or Susanna, when a cover goes beyond mere interpretation to outright reinvention, it does raise a question: If you're going to radically change a song until it's virtually unrecognizable, why not go all the way, write new lyrics, and call it something else? Revisiting Lou Reed's Transformer nugget ""Vicious"" as a piano ballad or ""Can't Shake Loose"" (a solo hit for ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog) as chamber gloom unfortunately further amplifies the perils and pointlessness of this kind of novelty.
Sure, recontextualizing songs can sometimes reveal something new about the source material. At least that's what the most gifted interpreters accomplish. But in Susanna's case, more often than not, the literal meaning of the lyrics is left intact after all else has been jettisoned. With every track projected through the same spectrum of depression, sadness, and misery, the song becomes unimportant and we're left only with her affected, ultimately monochromatic approach. As morbidly effective, thoroughly gorgeous, and sometimes wrenching as the results may be, in the end Susanna simply doesn't own these songs. She smothers and snuffs them out like a candle.",2009-01-27T06:00:05,['Electronic'],5.5,Rune Grammofon,Susanna: Flower of Evil Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12557-flower-of-evil/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2009-01-27,-2.6835616438356165,2009.0,0.0
5,Morgan Delt,['Morgan Delt'],"California native Morgan Delt is a homegrown musician whose debut evades convenient pigeonholing. The collection is a carefully built mosaic of jangly power pop, fuzzed out martian rock, and did-it-myself B-movie soundtracking that dissolves into a melted mess.
Our world is an impossibly and perhaps unnecessarily connected one, a place where household cats have Instagram feeds and most details of a life turn up after a deep Googling. No matter how much one attempts to stay off the grid, eventually something comes up. For example: The second page of Google results for “Morgan Delt” includes a character page for Morgan Delt, the protagonist of an obscure 1966 Vanessa Redgrave-starring film called Morgan—A Suitable Case of Treatment. Wikipedia describes him as “a failed irresponsible leftist artist” who’s obsessed with Karl Marx and gorillas; a characteristic quote from IMDB is something like, “[places skeleton on bed] Man is born to sorrow…”
If this is not California native Morgan Delt’s chosen pseudonym, it’s awfully telling of an interesting upbringing. He’s a homegrown musician whose debut self-titled album (which includes much of an earlier limited-edition cassette release) evades convenient pigeonholing. There’s the deal with the name, and then there's this: In one of the few interviews with Delt, the interviewer asks him to explain a song called ""Barbarian Kings"". ""I did have a story in mind with that song,"" he responds. ""I don't want to say too much about it though because what people imagine is usually more interesting. Your version is better!""
So, let's go ahead and imagine. In this album it’s easy to hear a band like the Byrds, who dabbled with jingle-jangle proto-power pop, fuzzed out martian rock, genteel country lament, and more during a five-year stretch in which members were swapped in and out depending on the mood. Rather than split time between such distinct states, Delt takes his armloads of sources—beyond the Byrds, you might describe the field of influence as sunny and stoned—and blends them into a variegated, melted mess. The result is a carefully built and naturalistic mosaic—you can hear the influences dissolving into each other even as the resulting sounds are crisp and memorable, rather than the half-baked invention of someone with a killer record collection. Listen to the taped-together percussion on opener ""Make My Grey Brain Green"", which rides a scratchy bass line and flowers into something like the moment when Dorothy's black-and-white world goes RGB. There's the Morricone-meets-Jodorowsky acid drone of ""Barbarian Kings"", the cyclical wobble of “Little Zombies”, the way ""Chakra Sharks"" rattles and crashes through a hornet’s nest of guitars into a wailing refrain of ""Bye bye, farewell."" Throughout the album there’s a heightened, eerie quality to his vocals; the feeling is something like an asylum patient waving to a car as it recedes over the horizon.
That's what I hear, at least. The whole album is so impressionistic and free-floating that you'll likely hear something else, as Delt intended. Projecting where he might go from here, it's not difficult to think of a band like Tame Impala, who temper spacey sprawl with more accessible songwriting. Future development doesn't have to be the point, of course; this album is fully-formed from first listen and begs return trips. There's another interaction from that interview that seems relevant: Asked if he believes in God, Delt simply replies, ""No."" If the faithless create their own meaning rather than wait for divine guidance, consider this an album that forces you to create your own attachments and associations. Even so, the artist is always present, elevating Morgan Delt from a wispy whatever into a clear statement of intent: It might not be obvious what you're supposed to hear, but you're going to hear something.",2014-01-27T06:00:04,['Rock'],7.6,Trouble in Mind,Morgan Delt: Morgan Delt Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18904-morgan-delt-morgan-delt/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2014-01-27,2.319178082191781,2014.0,0.0
6,"Woodstock Sessions, Vol. 4",['Team Sleep'],"Team Sleep was the first side project from the Deftones' Chino Moreno, and featured contributions from Mary Timony and Zach Hill. Ten years after the project's only album, the group has gathered to perform an intimate collection of album tracks and unreleased material recorded in front of a small live audience.
Team Sleep was Chino Moreno's first major side project, and the ones that came after were almost exactly like it—well-intentioned, admirably executed, and intermittently interesting amplifications of a trace element in Deftones' music. But upon the celebration of Team Sleep's 10th anniversary this past May, the band's only record, released in 2005 on a now-defunct major label, has taken on a Wet Hot American Summer-style, retroactive ""wow"" factor, both for its mere existence and the subsequent accomplishments of its already impressive cast. It now serves as the common link between Rufus Wainwright, Pinback, Ex Hex, Death Grips, Hole, and Faith No More (Melissa Auf der Maur and Mike Patton's contributions never made the final cut). That alone justifies revisiting Team Sleep, which is the ostensible purpose of Woodstock Sessions, Vol. 4. An intimate collection of album tracks and unreleased material recorded in front of a small live audience, the result is much more cohesive record than Team Sleep. It is also a less compelling one.
Mary Timony, Rob Crow, and producer Greg Wells (responsible for the Wainwright and, um, Mika connection) did not make it to upstate New York. It's just as well. Team Sleep was slapdash by default—it was nearly 10 years in the making and reconfigured after its planned 2003 release was scuttled by a leak. Downsizing the personnel rips out much of the inert stuffing that padded out Team Sleep's nearly hourlong runtime—Timony's solo cut (""Tomb of Liegia"") was proof enough that any vocalist can sound fairly anonymous doing Sneaker Pimps-style deadpan trip-hop, while the explosive anti-chemistry on ""King Diamond"" showed how much Moreno can embarrass himself without actually rapping. And while Zach Hill's participation technically qualifies Team Sleep as a retroactive Deftones/Death Grips supergroup, his metallic, skittering breakbeats mostly worked against Moreno rather than with him—the Deftones songs after which Team Sleep was modeled (""Teenager"", ""Lucky You"") tended to be muted, free of distorted guitars and all the better for it.
Hill has been replaced by Gil Sharone—a former member of the Dillinger Escape Plan who already has experience replacing a percussive maniac in a high-profile, alt-rock side project due to his time in +44. He ably recreates Hill's parts, but the wise selection of Team Sleep cuts ensure this is meant to be a more traditional rock record. Prior highlights ""(Ever) Foreign Flag"" and ""Princeton Review"" unlock themselves from a machinistic grid and take on an airy, major-key expansiveness that Moreno never quite achieved with Palms, even if they were focused on doing just that. Likewise, ""Blvd. Nights"" is angular, angry, and alive, while ""Live From the Stage"" stretches out to become the massive show closer it never had the chance to be.
While the Mo' Wax-worship on Team Sleep can be now seen as both its definitive feature and inherent flaw, the same could be said of Moreno's vocals on Woodstock Session**s. No matter the context, as long as Moreno is singing, you will be forced to compare it to Deftones. Dude can't help it—he's one of the most immediately identifiable stylists in mainstream rock from the past two decades, his vaporous, wavering melodies nearly impossible to trace and usually conveying a highly identifiable mix of sensuality and menace. This is even more true of Team Sleep than it was in ††† and Palms, so even the best work here ends up sounding like a weakened version of ""Tempest"" that wouldn't be capable of soundtracking Furious 7.
Such is the nature of Moreno's non-Deftones work: Moreno's outside projects do one thing, whereas Deftones are successful synthesists, playing up dynamic contrasts that come off as innovations. Woodstock Sessions is the third Moreno-fronted record to be released since Koi No Yokan, and it's the first where a new Deftones album is within view—though the when is unclear, they had promised a September due date back in March, and they officially finished recording about a month ago. As such, it's hard to feel disappointed in Woodstock Sessions or view it as a distraction. It just confirms what we keep finding out about Moreno's music outside of his main gig—it sounds either too much like Deftones or not enough unlike them.",2015-08-10T06:00:03,['Metal'],6.0,self-released,"Team Sleep: Woodstock Sessions, Vol. 4 Album Review | Pitchfork",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20907-woodstock-sessions-vol-4/,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2015-08-10,3.8534246575342466,2015.5,0.0
7,Songs From the Big Chair,['Tears for Fears'],"Tears for Fears’ second album is the one sound of pop-rock in the ’80s. Its personal psychology, meticulous compositions, and world-sized choruses evoked the loss of control in an overwhelming era.
Welcome to your life. From the moment you enter the world, you’re traumatized, first by your very birth, then by every subsequent moment of your existence, each of which will have a profound and significant effect on your behavior; in childhood, when you experience emotional distress, that pain remains, buried underneath time and memory.
In 1970, the psychologist Arthur Janov published The Primal Scream, in which he detailed his theory that the neuroses and baggage that adults carry with them are caused by repressed traumatic events from childhood. The same year, John Lennon and Yoko Ono underwent therapy sessions with Janov for about five months. Lennon channeled his experiences into his solo debut, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. He created one album out of his encounters with Janov; Tears for Fears based their entire career off of Janov’s work.
Even the band’s name is derived from The Primal Scream, on a theory of children’s nightmares. “Basically, if they are allowed to be themselves in their waking hours and are allowed to let their natural crying out, then they won’t dream up monsters at night to be scared of because they can’t face the reality of being scared of their parents,” bassist and co-singer Curt Smith told Will Hall, the author of Tears for Fears . . . Tales From the Big Chair. “Since emotional stress is the central issue here, the solution... is to encourage an emotional response so intense that the years of hidden anger and hurt are allowed to surface from the depths of the unconscious.”
On their second LP, 1985’s Songs From the Big Chair, Tears for Fears took a cue from Lennon and applied what they’d learned from Janov toward studies of single subjects: money, power, love, war, faith. But where Lennon went small, Tears for Fears went huge. They took the goth and synth-pop foundation they constructed on their debut, 1983’s The Hurting, and piled on saxophone, Fairlights, guitar solos, samplers, and live drums on top of drum machines. They wrote cresting choruses, arena-ready anthems, elegant ballads, and multi-section songs that have more in common with prog-rock than most of new wave. And they improbably created not just one of the biggest albums of the 1980s, but an album that manages to exude the 1980s in the same way that Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours conveys the lonely narcissism and hedonism of the ’70s, or Love’s Forever Changes captures both the bliss and the ominousness of the Summer of Love.
When Smith and Tears for Fears co-singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter Roland Orzabal went to record Songs From the Big Chair, the two possessed the kind of ambition necessary to produce an era-defining album. More than anything, Tears for Fears felt like they had something to prove to both critics and to themselves.
The Hurting went to number one on the UK album charts, sold a million copies, and yielded three top-five singles—“Mad World,” “Pale Shelter,” and “Change”—but the UK music press approached it with near hostility. In his review of the album for NME, Gavin Martin writes, “Sure, they may be popular—so was the Reverend Jim Jones when he took 5,000 followers to Guyana to commit mass suicide.” Orzabal told The Quietus, in an interview, “We weren’t particularly liked by some of the music journals. If you were on the front cover of Smash Hits, you were doomed.”
Part of the problem was that Tears for Fears came off as being too sincere—The Hurting was so explicit about its debt to Janov and The Primal Scream, and so lacking in subtlety, that the album cover depicted a child holding his head in his hands. But that sincerity belies the cosmetic gloss of the music. With its gleaming synthesizers, tight drum-machine programming, and minor-key melodies, The Hurting is a hallmark of early-80s dark wave and goth. That beauty came with a price: “It ended up taking a lot of time and costing a lot of money because we were fussy,” Smith told Hall. “The problem with it taking so long was that when we looked back at tracks we’d done months before we’d think, ‘Ooh, I don’t like that.’”
For Songs From the Big Chair, the band regrouped at their keyboardist Ian Stanley’s home studio in Somerset and rehired Chris Hughes, who also produced The Hurting. After a few false starts, Orzabal formed a brain trust of himself, Hughes, and Stanley, with Dave Bascombe providing engineering assistance and Smith signing off on ideas and making suggestions. They took inspiration from the music they were listening to, cerebral art-rock by Talking Heads, Brian Eno, Robert Wyatt, and Peter Gabriel. Smith confessed that his favorite album at the time was the Blue Nile’s A Walk Across the Rooftops. He could tell the Blue Nile had total artistic control—the music sounded calculated, finessed, meticulous.
In the documentary Scenes From the Big Chair, Orzabal revealed that the method Tears for Fears adopted was “fitting songs into interesting sounds.” To create the sounds, the squad in Somerset set up a formidable assembly of equipment: “a LinnDrum II box, a Drumulator drum box, a Roland Super Jupiter synthesizer, a Fairlight synthesizer, a DX7 keyboard, a rack of guitars, a Steinberger Bass, a Fender Stratocaster and a Gretsch maple drum kit,” according to Hughes. The main foursome would go in the studio from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., five days a week. They started by experimenting with individual fragments and then building them out. They took their time and loosened up their approach. Most importantly, they enjoyed themselves.
No track on Songs From the Big Chair exemplifies this free-roaming, tessellating approach more than its opener, the No. 1 single “Shout.” As Hughes told RBMA, “[Roland] set up a little drum box and a little synthesizer with a bass tone. He pressed the button on the drum box, and he programmed this little beat and it had these little chimey bells and a clapping drum beat. He pressed one of the keys and started singing, ‘Shout. Shout. Let it all out.’”
The template was an opportunity for Hughes, Orzabal, and Stanley to indulge. The structure of “Shout” is minimal, just one or two vocal melodies played over a steady drumbeat for around six-and-a-half minutes. But the thrust of the song is repetition, because as the hook grows and grows, the band keeps adding patches and instruments that compound the potency of the songwriting: a Fairlight-programmed ghostly synth-flute line, chippy guitar licks, and then a perfectly timed breakdown at 2:40, with a warped keyboard patch followed by a huge rush of Hammond organ and then a return to that earlier synth-flute, in a sequence that sounds like a brass band bursting through, then all of it blanketed by heavy-feedback guitars and backup vocals, a knifelike guitar solo running on top, and Orzabal and Smith still singing: “Shout. Shout. Let it all out/These are the things I can do without.”
“Shout” sounds tough. The drumbeat has an industrial, boxy shape and texture that resembles a march, with Orzabal and Smith’s joint vocals delivered almost as a chant. The song is just as explicit about primal therapy as virtually any other Tears for Fears track that predates it. But it’s less egregious, even though the execution is more direct. From the outset, Tears for Fears sound like they have a real purpose. The end of the verse is a declaration: I’m talking to you.
Tears for Fears named Songs From the Big Chair after the 1976 TV movie Sybil, in which Sally Field plays the title character, a woman with multiple personality disorder who could only prevent herself from using her different guises as defense mechanisms when she was sitting in her analyst’s chair. But the title also smartly references the music—because the songs all pertain to different sides of Tears for Fears’ personality—and that the band are delivering the album from an assured psychological state.
Tears for Fears could harness their self-confidence for a variety of tones and subjects, something that’s evident on “Head Over Heels,” another one of Songs From the Big Chair’s major singles. Whereas “Shout” is brooding and martial, “Head Over Heels” is dreamy and skeptical, with its glimpses of the joys of relationship chitchat (“I wanted to be with you alone /And talk about the weather”) and its swooning chorus, clouded in the band’s heavy, misty production. The music contradicts the narrative, in which the protagonist sabotages courtship because of his own self-hatred (“I made a fire, I’m watching it burn/I thought of your future”) and doubts that he can ever truly be in love (“I’m lost in admiration, could I need you this much?”). At this point, Tears for Fears could address their own insecurities without appearing wimpy or self-absorbed.
Songs From the Big Chair’s two ballads, “I Believe” and “Listen,” also manage to avoid preciousness or campiness, impressive because they’re the two parts of the album that most expose Tears for Fears’ love of progressive art-rock. “I Believe,” a gentle track that sounds like it was recorded in a piano bar, greatly resembles Robert Wyatt’s quirky, curling songwriting. The band is forthright about Wyatt’s influence, as corroborated by their engrossing, bare-bones cover of the singer-songwriter’s “Sea Song,” the B-side to “I Believe.” On the symphonic, largely instrumental “Listen,” pockets of blobby keyboard and electric guitar course through the song, with a world-music chorus at the end that sounds like a mash-up of Gabriel’s Security and Jon Hassell and Eno’s Fourth World Vol. 1: Possible Musics.
The first two verses of “Listen” also address the then-ongoing Cold War, and Songs From the Big Chair finds Tears for Fears engaging with politics more than ever before. On their first single, the propulsive “Mothers Talk,” the band juxtapose themes of motherhood with protests against nuclear war (“But when the weather starts to burn /Then you’ll know that you’re in trouble”), a canny insinuation that unresolved maternal issues lead to violence. On the simmering, nocturnal “The Working Hour,” Orzabal takes on the music business; its chorus, “This is the working hour/We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes,” straight-up calls out how record companies turn fun and creativity into manual labor and profit from it in the process.
Tears for Fears synthesize all of the threads on Songs From the Big Chair—intricacy, romance, psychology, and politics—on the album’s centerpiece, the everlasting “Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” Hughes says that he, Orzabal, and Stanley put the song together in a week, astonishing because the track has so many components: the twinkling synth at the beginning joined by a spider-like guitar, the snappy instrumental lead-up to the opening verse, the shuffling drum beat, the chorus, the galvanizing bridge, a moody instrumental passage, a guitar solo, a new melody for a verse afterwards, another guitar solo. And the genius of “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” is how it escalates, how each part increasingly amplifies the passion of the music.
More than any other Tears for Fears track, “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” most successfully transposes Janov’s psychological texts into a pop song with global resonance. Though “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” is obviously a meditation on power, you could project virtually every major issue of the 1980s onto the lyrics: the environment (“Turn your back on mother nature”), the fleeting nature of financial success (“Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure/Nothing ever lasts forever”), authoritarian rule (“Even while we sleep/We will find you”), and the Cold War (“Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down”).
“Everybody Wants to Rule the World” is a song with a near-universal appeal, and likewise Songs From the Big Chair seemed to resonate with everyone—jocks, goths, pre-teens, adults. “At our gigs, you’ll get young girls at the front, the Joy Division fans at the back and even some hippies putting in an appearance,” Smith told Hall. “Our fan mail is certainly very varied, containing letters from everyone from twelve-year-old girls to mothers with five-year-old daughters.”
It took four years for Tears for Fears to follow up Songs From the Big Chair, and what came out of it was The Seeds of Love, an overambitious, elaborate, refined, and somewhat underrated album. Orzabal supposedly alienated everyone—Smith, Hughes, and Stanley—during its production, mostly due to his perfectionism. For a while, it seemed Tears for Fears had faded away, a relic of an era too gauche to respect anymore. The only place you might find them was on “Dennis Miller Live,” which used “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” as its opening theme.
Then, Tears for Fears turned up in an unlikely place: Donnie Darko, a film that subverts ’80s teen movies. “Head Over Heels” is memorably included during a slow-motion montage, but Tears for Fears were mostly rediscovered by younger audiences thanks to Michael Andrews and Gary Jules’ cover of “Mad World.” By peeling away all the circuitry and flash of the original, replacing the gizmos with mostly non-electronic instruments, and slowing the tempo, Andrews and Jules exposed “Mad World” as the post-9/11 emo ballad it was perhaps destined to be. As the 2000s progressed, you’d hear Tears for Fears incrementally more often. In 2008 Kanye West sampled the chorus of The Hurting’s “Memories Fade” on “Coldest Winter,” from 808s & Heartbreak, coincidentally about an artist trying to deal with the death of his mother.
Today you’ll hear “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” all over the place—it’s a staple of classic-rock radio, pharmacies, bars, and parties. But at its core the song is still dealing with Janov; with how, ultimately, what human beings want is control, and the inability to control your own life is misdirected into a desire to overpower other people. It’s a constant with Songs From the Big Chair: interior drama is construed as being about collective suffering. Personal chaos is universal. Welcome to your life. There’s no turning back.",2017-08-20T05:00:00,['Rock'],8.9,Mercury,Tears for Fears: Songs From the Big Chair Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tears-for-fears-songs-from-the-big-chair/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2017-08-20,5.883561643835616,2017.5,0.0
8,Soft Opening,['Posse'],"On their sophomore album Soft Opening, Seattle indie rockers Posse imbue their no-frills, rumpled indie rock with a discernible point of view and more importantly, a personality.
Posse does not have some kind of marvelous origin story, there is no blood oath or volatile, undeniable chemistry. The songwriting duo of Paul Wittmann-Todd and Sacha Maxim met during a show at a Seattle lesbian bar and decided to collaborate because the former ""didn't have a lot of other options."" On their sophomore album Soft Opening, Wittmann-Todd and Maxim exhibit that same kind of non-committal camaraderie, as their vocals do not harmonize or intertwine or do battle; most of the time, they exchange one-sided conversations, acknowledging each other and going about their business. Every instrument is given enough space to do whatever it wants as long as it cleans up after itself. It's the musical equivalent of roommates who randomly linked up on Craigslist and totally worked things out. Whatever qualities this might suggest in Posse as people lend a lived-in bumminess to Soft Opening, imbuing its no-frills, rumpled indie rock with a discernible point of view and more importantly, a personality.
That’s important, because this is really no-frills indie rock. The most notable studio tricks Posse employ are a fuzz pedal, a tambourine, and the occasional echo on Maxim’s vocals. Either Wittmann-Todd is playing an extremely avant-garde solo during a portion of “Jon” or they simply didn’t feel like overdubbing a flubbed take. On the up-tempo numbers, Posse recall a rainy day Real Estate, a less bookish Galaxie 500, or Yo La Tengo driven by a equivocal, platonic friendship. On slower-than-slowcore “Talk"", they’re all but mesmerized by their own torpor, situated somewhere in between Pavement’s “Stop Breathing” and Built to Spill’s “Cleo” in terms of uncomfortably numb guitar heroism. Similar to those bands, Posse make music that is lo-fi without sounding cheap, purposeful minimalism that can sound strangely expansive: Maxim and Wittmann-Todd’s vocals are barely projected without being off-key, and the guitar leads have an effortless melodicism whenever they take over. Even if most of these songs could be strummed out from a beanbag chair, Posse always add a chord that fancies things up just enough.
Posse describe their sound as “delay pedals and 27 years of disappointment”, which may not be factually correct; you hear a lot more of the latter than the former, and the second line of opener “Interesting Thing No. 2” is “You turned 25, so many things you haven’t tried.” It’s theoretically sound all the same, since Soft Opening’s self-deprecation is a big part of its appeal. For all of its invocations of 80s and 90s A-listers, Soft Opening is an of-the-moment record in the way it aligns with the sort of sitcoms that dominate the viewing habits of people Posse’s age: the actors involved are presented as friends, yet they don’t really seem to like each other all that much.
In the case of Soft Opening, nearly every song is a subtly hilarious metacommentary on some sort of communication breakdown. Maxim sings, “I know you’re gonna talk through this and not care,” and you can easily visualize the shoulder shrug, the eye-rolling, the internal defeat she anticipates with this interaction. With every repetition, it cuts deeper and deeper as an insult: you are someone who simply can’t handle sitting in silence with their own feelings. A song later on “Shut Up”, a drunk and bored Wittmann-Todd fantasizes about a time when he’s going to work up the nerve to tell someone to shut their yap, even if it’s himself: “I’m gonna watch you go outside now/ And make a stupid face/ And shut up.""
And yet, none of this venting comes off as mean-spirited. In fact, most of Soft Opening unwinds with the casual bonhomie of three post-work beers over darts; the deleterious effects are minimal compared to the necessary release and bonding. And hell, if Posse seem to have a strange enjoyment for each other’s company in spite of it all, well, it’s because the outside world doesn’t have that much more to offer. “Cassandra B.” relates a date between overeducated, underfunded Seattlites as they down too much vodka, go to an “intelligent rap” show (“A bald white guy/ With a mumu onstage”) and lie about reading Willa Cather books that were bought at college and promptly shelved. As with every dryly hysterical line on Soft Opening, there’s never any “pitchiness”; it’s never trying to be any more droll and absurd than life itself.
Despite the litany of disappointments, misunderstandings, and aimlessness befalling the narrators in these songs, Soft Opening is a record of oddly stoic presence. For one thing, the austere sonics and plainspoken lyrics ensure that nothing gets glossed overso it's a tough record to tune out. But also, Posse sound exactly like the band they want to be—you don’t sense any musical ambition unmet, any word misplaced. It’s a modest record done confidently, enough to end with a six-minute guitar workout based around the lyric that perfectly encapsulates Soft Opening’s comforting sadness, its satisfied misanthropy: “Don’t touch me/ I’m in my zone.”",2014-03-13T06:00:04,['Rock'],7.9,Beating A Dead Horse,Posse: Soft Opening Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19132-posse-soft-opening/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2014-03-13,2.4424657534246577,2014.0,0.0
9,Black Sun,['Kode9 & the Spaceape'],"Hyperdub's flagship producer once again teams up with the earthen-voiced dread poet to find new ways of injecting a sense of anxiety into dubstep.
Dubstep's crossover bid-- whether James Blake's introspective fragility or Katy B's pop hybridization-- is starting to obscure one of the genre's initial strengths: the way it could transmit anxiety. The soupy low-end and skittering hi-hats of a 2006 Hyperdub side made the ideal soundtrack for a sense of encroaching doom-- whether it was Burial's affecting desolation or a bracing dose of Kode9 & the Spaceape. The teamup of Hyperdub's flagship producer with the earthen-voiced poet resulted in an underappreciated full-length, Memories of the Future, which shot chest-collapsing bass and gutter synthesizers through firebrand reggae. Their next prominent collaboration was a cover of the Specials' ""Ghost Town"" that appeared on 5: Five Years of Hyperdub and made the already grave original sound like a Less Than Jake song by comparison. If there are standard-bearers for dubstep's more evocatively disquieting tendencies, it's these two.
Given how many trends have shifted in the past five years, it's not worth debating how Black Sun fits in the current post-Blake, post-Rusko, post-Magnetic Man landscape. Instead, the album has the tricky but crucial task of keeping an archetypal strain of bass music part of an increasingly busy conversation. It does that to an extent, but a few key changes to the partnership's approach prove how much the formula can stretch. The duo's tension-driven personality has been preserved, but the tweaks are noticeable-- instead of sinking into a single-minded atmosphere of futurist foreboding, the music is more sprightly and intricate, adding subtle stylistic retorts to the production's more aggressive traits.
An easy case study would be to compare the 2009 version of the album's titular single with the ""Partial Eclipse Version"" that appears here. The original track was a bit of a left turn at the time-- woozy 8-bit drones and a funky-inflected rhythm. Revamped here, its frantic rush is dialed down just enough to amplify the old-school Detroit feel that was overpowered in the original mix-- less a panic attack than a nervous glance over the shoulder. The deceptively simple beats for ""Love Is the Drug"" and ""Otherman"" set dissonant, uneasy chords against sturdy, upbeat funky house rhythms, forcing otherwise unpredictable melodies into an offhand catchiness. And with its sizzling analog synthesizer decay, ""Kryon"", the beautiful album-closing collaboration with Flying Lotus, feels less like a gratuitous guest spot and more like a culmination of Black Sun's equilibrium between pressured propulsion and elegiac calm.
Meanwhile, the Spaceape still resonates, thanks to a voice suited for slow-burn tension and corrosive damnation. This time around it's less smothered in filters and reverb, giving him a little more clarity. Whether he's abstracting a harrowing physical breakdown (""Black Smoke"") or sprinting through war-zone resilience (""Bullet Against Bone""), the Spaceape finds a way to make even the most severe lyrics hit as slickly and nimbly as the snare rolls he weaves through. Tension and anxiety don't always have to be cavernous and austere, and Black Sun reveals a way for dubstep's vanguard to express their more ominous impulses in a way you can still dance to, no matter how the steps change.",2011-04-18T06:00:02,['Electronic'],7.7,Hyperdub,Kode9 & the Spaceape: Black Sun Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15310-black-sun/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2011-04-18,-0.46164383561643835,2011.25,0.0
10,Years of Refusal,['Morrissey'],"Morrissey and his Tormentors continue their 21st century winning streak with a record that, while offering no new twists or surprises, finds the former Smiths co-leader in strong voice-- both as a singer and songwriter.
Last time we saw Morrissey, on a rather slapdash Greatest Hits compilation, he was singing a song called ""All You Need Is Me"" and promising ""You'll miss me when I'm gone."" Neither proposition seemed watertight: His 2000s return to action had been welcome but rarely spectacular, and the man looked set on a twilit career of gently diminishing returns. So Years of Refusal comes as a gratifying shock: It's his most vital, entertaining, and savage record since 1994's Vauxhall and I.
What's surprising is that so little seems different. The personnel are largely unchanged: backing band the Tormentors and co-writers including old hands Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte. The approach is unchanged: muscular rock with plenty of room for Morrissey to roam and gesture and half an ear on live performance. Even some of the songs are unchanged: the new tracks from Greatest Hits show up again, though ""All You Need Is Me"" is transformed by context-- surrounded by fine new songs, you notice its snarl, flamboyance, and garage rock grind. Rather than try and reinvent himself, Morrissey has rediscovered himself, finding new potency in his familiar arsenal.
Morrissey's rejuvenation's most obvious in the renewed strength of his vocals. On the barnstorming opener, ""Something Is Squeezing My Skull"", he switches from fruity to fierce with impeccable timing-- the ringing leaps up the scale on ""skull,"" the matter-of-fact checklist of drugs and mental treatments, and then the break into anger and desperation: ""How long must I stay on this stuff?"" On his old album sleeves, Morrissey would sometimes capitalize stray phrases for particular emphasis-- these days, when he wants to make a point, you hear those capitals.
By ""Skull""'s ferocious closing he should have won stray fans back, and he keeps the energy levels high across most of the record. Much of the album was tracked live in the studio, and their leader's vigor seems to have rubbed off on the band. Not only do the songs have a snappy ferocity, they're full of unexpected touches in the arrangement-- the discordant keyboards on ""Mama Lay Softly on the Riverbed"", or the cod-mariachi flourishes on ""One Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell"". This makes Years of Refusal a rarity-- a Morrissey record you can dig into without caring much about the man's lyrics.
When you do pay attention to the words, Morrissey is on typically quotable form. He long ago got into the habit of paring his lyrics down into aphorisms-- ""You don't like me but you love me/ Either way you're wrong""-- which run the risk of sounding too pat and polished: The source of much of the ""self-parody"" flak that flies his way. There's plenty of sigfile fodder here, but it's balanced by more startling imagery: ""I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine""; ""I was a small fat child in a welfare house""; and perhaps his most eyebrow-raising couplet ever: ""The motion of taxis excites me when you peel it back and bite me.""
For much of Years of Refusal Morrissey is turning his fire outwards-- taking on lovers, enemies, wannabes, or some combination of all three. On ""The Last Time I Saw Carol"", his younger admirer winds up dead and Morrissey responds with detached regret. On ""You Were Good in Your Time"" he paints a mournful and wandering picture of a dwindled hero-- he knows and you know he's self-aware enough to be singing partly about himself. But only partly: This is Morrissey's most venomous, score-settling album, and in a perverse way that makes it his most engaging.
Fitting then that Years of Refusal's peak is its angriest track: ""It's Not Your Birthday Anymore"" starts tender, but something callous is stewing beneath its padding drums and gentle croon. ""Did you really think we meant all those syrupy sentimental things that we said?"" sings Morrissey, before the song takes a still darker turn into grudgeful, violent sexuality. In its cruelty and intensity, it's a cousin to Pulp's ""This Is Hardcore"", and it's the most disturbing, gripping Morrissey track since 1994's ""Speedway"". Even though the album dies away after ""Birthday"", it and its more raucous predecessors suggest an artist as pugnacious, confident, and necessary as he's ever been.",2009-02-03T06:00:01,['Rock'],8.1,Lost Highway,Morrissey: Years of Refusal Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12640-years-of-refusal/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2009-02-03,-2.664383561643836,2009.0,0.0
11,What the Day Was Dreaming,['Maquiladora'],"The great comedian Louis Black once theorized-- in a characteristic fit of high blood pressured rage-- that being a weatherman ...
The great comedian Louis Black once theorized-- in a characteristic fit of high blood pressured rage-- that being a weatherman in San Diego is the easiest job in the world: ""It's gonna be...nice,"" is about all you'd ever have to say, he commented, and every time I check San Diego on Weather.com, he appears to be right. Maybe I'm just checking on the good days, but it always seems to be about 70 degrees and sunny there. As I type, it's 69 and partly cloudy. My college friends from San Diego even suffered like crazy in the Boston winter. Given the situation on the ground, I'm not sure what's got the three guys in Maquiladora so down.
Maquiladora refer to what they do as ""desert rock,"" which only really makes sense in that San Diego isn't too far from the desert. Let me tell you, desert rock is a friend of mine, and this ain't him. Friends of Dean Martinez, Calexico, Rainer Ptacek-- that's desert rock; I'm getting no inkling of thousand-year-old sagebrush, burrowing gerbils or wind-rippled dunes from What the Day Was Dreaming. 'Course, these guys are free to call their music whatever they want, and though it may sound like 100% lo-fi dirge to me, I guess the image of a deserted town is a fairly appropriate one. The slowly shifting background textures (including some fascinating guitarwork by Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata) in ""Heartbroken"" could be the wind creaking through some untrodden alley, just as easily as the crippled steel guitars, xylophones and pianos that litter the album could signify rusting cars and rotting fences.
What the Day Was Dreaming (the band's fourth overall, but only the second widely available in the States) is frequently evocative-- the melodic bass and gently sung da-da-da's of ""Dr. Said No"" are inviting, the way humid night air feels when you leave an overly air-conditioned building. Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins (who also ran the boards on this recording) contributes some spooky saw to closer ""Liam"", a song that spends nearly its full duration retreating from standard forms, but that still feels haunted and empty.
Evocative's great, of course, and it's wonderful when a band really draws you into the mood of their album, but a record that's all mood can wear off pretty quickly. None of these songs present their melodies distinctly enough for them to make a lasting impression, which is a shame, really, because by the time minute #60 rolls around, they've likely lost you completely, despite any number of striking moments along the way. ""Drunk & Lighting Fires (A Waltz)"" feels brilliant when it's playing, an elegantly wasted guitar grind of funereal indie rock topped with discordant horns, but when it's over, it's really over-- the next song, yet another with a hanging sense of sameness and anonymous malaise, easily wipes it from memory.
Even when Maquiladora come close to developing a really good hook, like with the guitar part to ""Kiss Over"", it could always be sharper, and that's Maquiladora's ultimate failing. What the Day Was Dreaming is full of arresting moments that release you just when they're about to get a confession from you, and at a full hour, you're almost guaranteed to take a break from it somewhere along the line. 2002's Ritual of Hearts actually did a better job of insinuating itself with the listener, and remains the album to go to first if you're interested. But while Maquiladora prove themsleves able crafters of atmosphere here, it's going to take some more developed songs to make them anything more.",2003-07-24T05:00:00,['Rock'],5.0,Darla,Maquiladora: What the Day Was Dreaming Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5100-what-the-day-was-dreaming/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2003-07-24,-8.2013698630137,2003.5,0.0
12,White Light/White Heat,['The Velvet Underground'],"Best new reissue
When the Velvet Underground's second album descended on the world in January, 1968, nobody was ready for it. As the story goes, it was a relentless, screeching, thudding, scoffing assault on the pop sensibilities of its time. For its 45th anniversary it's been reissued in expanded, remastered form, and listening to White Light/White Heat now, it doesn't quite fit the template of its legend.
When the Velvet Underground's second album descended on the world in January, 1968, nobody was ready for it. The Velvet Underground and Nico, the year before, had had Andy Warhol's imprimatur to promise that its passages of bleeding-raw chaos were art; it had also had the complicated but unmistakable beauty of the songs Nico sang as a lifeline for the tiny mainstream audience that caught on to it at the time. White Light/White Heat didn't have either.
By the time they released it, the Velvets were downplaying the art-world connection (despite the very arty slash in the album's title, and the fact that its black-on-black sleeve was designed by the Factory's Billy Name). Nico was out of the band, although bassist John Cale would continue to work with her for years. And the album was a relentless, screeching, thudding, scoffing assault on the pop sensibilities of its time: six songs with lyrics designed to horrify the bourgeoisie (not that they'd have listened to the Velvet Underground in the first place), ending with a one-take, two-chord, 17-minute speedfreakout. It clung to the bottom of the album chart for two weeks, disappeared, and went on to become the glorious, tainted fountain from which all scuzz flows.
That's the White Light/White Heat of legend, anyway. For its 45th anniversary—closer to its 46th, but keeping time was never their strong point—it's been reissued in expanded, remastered form, as if what this pinnacle of sloppy noise needed was remastering. As always, the title track, which seems like it should start cold with Cale and Sterling Morrison's backing vocals, sounds like it's had a little trimmed off the top to remove an extraneous sound—although, of course, extraneous sounds are kind of the whole point of this album.
Listening to White Light/White Heat now, it doesn't quite fit the template of its legend. For one thing, Lou Reed's songwriting is often a lot more conventional than it's reputed to be. Strip away the noise and flash and references to illicit drugs and sex, and ""White Light/White Heat"", ""Here She Comes Now"", and ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" are all the sort of simple rock'n'roll readymades that Reed had been cranking out at Pickwick Records a couple of years earlier. (So is ""Guess I'm Falling In Love"", recorded in scorching instrumental form at the White Light sessions, which is practically the same song as the Rutles' ""I Must Be In Love"".)
For another, the live disc appended to this edition is a reminder that the Velvet Underground were radical in a totally acceptable way for their time—that, professionally speaking, they were a party band with an audience of hippies, who appeared on bills with the likes of Sly & the Family Stone, Canned Heat, Iron Butterfly, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Chicago Transit Authority the year White Light/White Heat came out. The performance, apparently from John Cale's collection, was recorded at the Gymnasium in New York in April, 1967 (two of its songs previously appeared on the 1995 Peel Slowly and See box set). It presents the Velvets as a full-on boogie band, whose set is bookended by the instrumental grooves ""Booker T."" and ""The Gift""—turns out they're slightly different songs, contrary to what VU fans have assumed for the past few decades. The rest of the gig includes what might or might not have been the first public performance of ""Sister Ray"" (it was still a very new song, at any rate), and one legit addition to the canon: ""I'm Not a Young Man Anymore"", a chugging electric blues that wouldn't have been out of place in Creedence Clearwater Revival's early repertoire.
So once this mysterious black-on-black artifact is demystified, what's left of it? More mystery, it turns out. What possessed Cale to start playing an out-of-time, two-note bass part louder than anything else at the end of ""White Light/White Heat"", and how could he have guessed that that was a great idea? Was the famous split-second pause before Reed's splatterbomb solo on ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" intentional? What the fuck was up with Reed filling in words—""SWEETLY!""—in the middle of Cale's vocal on ""Lady Godiva's Operation"", and why is it still hilarious? Speaking of that song, might lyrics about a delicate hypersexual creature interacting with ""another curly-headed boy,"" directly followed by a medical horror-show, have anything to do with a curly-headed songwriter who was given electroconvulsive therapy to ""cure"" his bisexuality as a teenager? Why is ""Sister Ray"" way, way more potent than any other extended jam on a simple riff by an American band of the 60s?
It's surprising to hear anything besides the universe catching its breath after ""Sister Ray"" ends, but the first disc of this reissue is filled out with other previously released evidence of John Cale's final months in the Velvet Underground: the instrumental ""Guess I'm Falling In Love"", both versions of the electric-viola showcase ""Hey Mr. Rain"", and the band's thoroughly charming stab at making a commercially viable single, ""Temptation Inside Your Heart""/""Stephanie Says"". There's also a previously unheard alternate take of ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" (not quite as good as the official one, and mostly interesting to hear which of Reed's apparent ad-libs weren't), and one fascinating curio: an early version of ""Beginning to See the Light"", recorded at the ""Temptation Inside Your Heart"" session. By the time the song appeared on The Velvet Underground in 1969, it had become lither and wittier, and Reed had sharpened a few of its lyrics; this broad-shouldered, clomping version is distinctly not there yet, but everything the Velvets released on their official albums is so canonical that it's strange and heartening to realize that their songs didn't just spring into existence already perfect.",2014-01-16T06:00:00,['Rock'],10.0,Interscope,The Velvet Underground: White Light/White Heat Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18770-the-velvet-underground-white-lightwhite-heat/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2014-01-16,2.289041095890411,2014.0,0.0
13,Are You Alone?,['Majical Cloudz'],"The new Majical Cloudz album picks up where Impersonator left off: Stark, ethereal instrumentals buoyed by frontman Devon Welsh's unflinching voice. His counterpart, Matthew Otto, doesn't try and approximate backing musicians so much as create vapor trails where backing musicians might've stood. Their music is kind of an emotional strip show: Welsh knows it's a performance but he still ends up naked.
Halfway through Majical Cloudz's set at the 2014 Pitchfork Music Festival, the music cut out, leaving singer Devon Welsh alone with a live microphone in front of 6,000 people. The scene put a new spin on an old bad dream: Not only had Welsh shown up to class without clothes on, but the classroom had become a baseball field and everyone on it was a little bit drunk.
After a couple of dumb jokes (the packing peanuts of any good showman), Welsh canvassed the audience for requests and ended up singing an a capella version of an already startlingly intimate song called ""Bugs Don't Buzz"" from the band's 2013 album Impersonator (""If life could be forever one instant/ Would it be the moment you met me? No, my love"").
For some bands, the moment might've constituted disaster, but for Majical Cloudz it was a logical endpoint to their music, which functions as a kind of emotional strip show: Welsh knows it's a performance but he still ends up naked. When the song was over, the crowd clapped with embarrassed hesitation: Should we be watching this? And should Welsh be doing it?
The band's new album, Are You Alone?, picks up where Impersonator left off: Stark, ethereal instrumentals buoyed by Welsh's unflinching voice. Musically, their roots are in English romantics like Depeche Mode, themselves a moody electronic gloss on the lieder that composers like Franz Schubert were writing 150 years earlier. Philosophically, they chart a junction of new age and hardcore punk, both of which prize a radical scraping away of excess in their search for truth. Majical Cloudz want empathy and they want it now.
I call them a ""band"" but should note how they stretch the definition of the word. As a singer, Welsh performs with the confidence and intimacy of someone holding a hairbrush in front of their bedroom mirror—the music is mostly in his head. His counterpart, Matthew Otto, is less visible but equally important. A former student in an electroacoustic studies program that emphasized sound design as much as composition, Otto doesn't try and approximate backing musicians so much as create vapor trails where backing musicians might've stood. If the name Majical Cloudz has any bearing on their sound, it's because of him: He's the air Welsh breathes.
Alone is less stripped-down than Impersonator, but it feels less confrontational, too. The band recently went on tour opening for Lorde, and seem to have figured out how to broaden their sound while softening it at the same time, all without losing the detonating high that made Impersonator so remarkable. Songs like ""So Blue"" and ""Downtown""—both standouts—are easy to imagine as more fully fleshed out pieces of music, conveying size without occupying space. Like photographic negatives, you can still see the image but the inversion of blacks and whites lends it a kind of alien melancholy.
Like Impersonator, Alone is a sad album, but its sadness is a kind of tall tale, the details of which are overblown for dramatic effect. At times its lyrics sound less like expressions of personal darkness than advertisements for darkness in general, written in lettering so big you could read it from the highway. In a recent interview with Pitchfork, he professed his admiration for Andy Kaufman, an artist usually classified as a comedian but whose work tends to function more like social performance art. The connection makes sense: Like Kaufman, Welsh tends to scramble performance and sincerity, laying himself bare in a way that seems more honest when he's onstage than it might in so-called real life. At peak he becomes a kind of Puberty Incarnate, bearer of feelings so awkward and yet so incandescent that they seem like a joke and a dare at the same time.
A few weeks ago, I blew off part of an afternoon to see the Pixar movie Inside Out, which follows the inner life of a young girl named Riley as personified by five fundamental emotions: joy, fear, anger, disgust, and sadness. The emotions—characters unto themselves—run around Riley's head jockeying for control, turning each new experience into a color-coded orb later filed away in Riley's labyrinthine memory.
Early on, Sadness—a dumpy, self-effacing Midwestern woman—is portrayed as a kind of negative-force King Midas, unwittingly ruining Riley's memories by turning them a cool, melancholy blue. The movie's revelation is when Joy—cannily represented as part-Tinkerbell, part passive-aggressive control freak—starts to realize that Sadness isn't a threat to Riley but a necessary catalyst for her growth, not a barrier to Joy but a bridge. Toward the end, a new feeling pops out of Riley's psychological conveyor belt: The yellow of Joy and the blue of Sadness, swirled together like ribbons inside a marble.
The moral is simple, but in a culture obsessed by happiness, it seems surprising, too: Maybe sadness isn't just an O.K. feeling to have, but an essential part of our emotional balance. Without it, we live in monochrome.
I kept thinking of Majical Cloudz, whose music—like *Inside Out—*seems to recast sadness as a feeling that doesn't damage the self but helps keep it whole. Now, when I see that album title (Are You Alone?), it seems less like a grim rhetorical question than an invitation—the kind of thing you might ask someone who is alone but looks like they could use a little company.",2015-10-13T06:00:00,['Rock'],8.0,Matador,Majical Cloudz: Are You Alone?

14,American Interior,['Gruff Rhys'],"Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys' latest solo project was inspired by his recent discovery that he's a descendent of John Evans, a Welsh explorer from the 1790s. The resulting LP is far more robust and widescreen-scaled than the modest, folk-oriented music Rhys has thus far released under his own name, in tune with the Super Furry Animals’ manic genre-blurring, retro-futurist mandate.
Depending on which 20th-anniversary thinkpiece pops up in your Twitter feed at any given moment, Britpop was either a prideful display of national unity that provided the triumphant soundtrack to a post-Thatcher England, or a malignant, creatively stunting cancer that’s rotted contemporary U.K. rock music to its hollow core. But even if you lean toward the latter opinion, we can all agree on one positive outcome of the Blur-vs.-Oasis arms race: It injected Creation Records with enough cash for the label to roll the dice on Welsh wackaloons the Super Furry Animals, the rare rock band of the era that was more interested in exploring the future (and all the toxic mobile-phone radiation that comes with it) than repackaging the past. And while they never approached tabloid-level, supermodel-shagging celebrity status, their steady success in the U.K. over the past decade-and-a-half has afforded frontman Gruff Rhys the means to indulge his various whims—which are never in short supply.
Rhys’ capacious curiosity is given even greater room to roam with his latest solo project—the operative word being “project,” in the studious high-school-class-presentation sense. Its roots lie in Rhys’ recent discovery that he's a descendent of John Evans, a Welsh explorer who, in the 1790s, embarked on a solo voyage through America to locate the Mandan, an obscure tribe of Welsh-speaking Indians linked to a 12th-century Welsh prince named Madoc (who, as legend has it, touched down on our continent a good 300 years before Columbus). But rather than just update his Ancestry.com page and call it a day, Rhys booked a tour along the same path his forefather traversed. This wasn’t your standard-issue solo-acoustic campaign, but a multimedia PowerPoint presentation—booked into art galleries and lecture halls—chronicling Evans’ journey, interspersed with new songs inspired by it. Given that Evans died long before the invention of the camera, and no paintings of the man exist, Super Furry Animals’ go-to artist Pete Fowler built a puppet version of his imagined likeness to serve as Rhys’ onstage second banana and travel companion. Because that’s how Gruff Rhys rolls.
The tour is chronicled in Rhys’ new documentary with co-director Dylan Goch, American Interior, which is currently making the rounds on the festival circuit. But for those not in the vicinity of a screening, there’s this namesake 13-song companion album, which provides a vivid retelling of the story even in the absence of visuals. “100 Unread Messages” essentially serves the same function as the Raiders of the Lost Ark-style dot-to-dot maps that plot Evans’ trek in the film, detailing his initial arrival in Philadelphia, en route to St. Louis and up the Missouri River, and then down to his final resting place in New Orleans. But even this straight-forward travelogue is infused with Rhys’ ever-peculiar musings: As he explains in the film, the song is told from the perspective of someone who’s been trying to email John Evans repeatedly but, for obvious reasons, receives no reply, thereby transforming the biography of an historical figure into a comment on the mind-warping effects of internet addiction. And the track’s countrified Krautrock stomp—supplied by excommunicated Flaming Lips drummer and fellow Native-American enthusiast Kliph Scurlock—is far more robust and widescreen-scaled than the modest, folk-oriented music Rhys has thus far released under his own name, positioning American Interior as the Rhys solo release that’s most in tune with the Super Furry Animals’ manic genre-blurring, retro-futurist mandate.
Really, if this had been released as the first SFA album in five years, no fan would complain, as it encompasses several of the band’s signature modes: the ace-in-the-hole ’70s soft-rock throwbacks (“The Last Conquistador”), the nursery-rhyme funk jams with impossible-to-pronounce hooks (“Allweddellau Allweddol”), the multi-sectional, pedal-steeled prog-pop opuses (“Year of the Dog” and its instrumental-coda counterpart “Tiger’s Tale”). And by fortuitous fuzzy logic, the hair-raising, string-swept cavalry charge “Iolo” works as both a nod to the Welsh poet that backed out of Evans’ expedition at the last minute, and a sonic manifestation of Drake’s phonetically related philosophy. But the Evans narrative provides an emotional throughline that connects and grounds this stylistically free-ranging collection—for all his apparent eccentricity, Rhys has always been an exceptional balladeer, and poignant, piano-bound turns like “Walk Into the Wilderness” feel all the more affecting in the light of the real hardship that inspired it.
But Rhys’ affinity for John Evans clearly goes beyond mere blood relations—for Rhys, Evans was the original Welsh punk, who pursued his vision despite the ridicule, incarceration, and isolating loneliness inherent to the mission. And like so many of the punk icons we lionize today, Evans may have been considered a failure in his lifetime (spoiler alert: his story does not end happily), but his work proved highly influential to those that followed: historians claim his hand-drawn maps of the American northwest were crucial to Lewis and Clark’s landmark maiden expedition to the left coast in the early 19th century. With American Interior, Rhys not only follows in Evans’ footsteps but, in his own way, helps fulfill his original mission: If, years from now, social anthropologists note an unusually high concentration of Super Furry Animals fans along the Missouri, we’ll know why.",2014-05-13T06:00:02,['Rock'],8.0,Turnstile,Gruff Rhys: American Interior Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19323-gruff-rhys-american-interior/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2014-05-13,2.6095890410958904,2014.25,0.0
15,Era Vulgaris,['Queens of the Stone Age'],"Josh Homme and co. follow their first post-Nick Oliveri album-- the quality Lullabies to Paralyze-- with a more diverse record, one that tries its best to be everything all at once, often within one track.
It may seem cheap to bring up the departure of Nick Oliveri three years and two albums after he was fired from Queens of the Stone Age, but the more I listen to Era Vulgaris, the more I think his presence is sorely missed. I'm not advocating the guy's return, but the tradeoff between Josh Homme's reserved cool and Olivieri's crazy-go-nuts screaming was one of the group's strengths in their heyday; years later, someone for Homme to play off would still be a welcome addition to the band.
Queens of the Stone Age has been mostly Homme's show ever since, and it's been a mixed bag so far. Lullabies to Paralyze was quality, a chance for QOTSA v2.0 to retrench and carve out their own niche, even if those who were less enamored with the album's glowering charms, saw that niche as a rut-- an example of what Oliveri's loss actually meant to the group. If Era Vulgaris is any indication, the group felt the same way: This album tries its best to be everything all at once (often within one track), and in attempting to cover too much ground, the band loses focus and direction.
It's not so much that the songs themselves are weak, just that many of the choices made in them are. For instance, ""Sick, Sick, Sick"" would be better off simply sticking with Homme's motor-mouthed singing and riffing; instead, the song bellyflops into a flat chorus where everyone sings like they're scared of their own voices. (Since the Strokes' Julian Casablancas guests on this song, let's blame him. Why not?) Elsewhere, Homme spreads his falsetto all over ""Misfit Love"", where it'd be more effective in shorter bursts, while the obnoxious bridge on album closer ""Run Pig Run"" (it pops up twice!) kills any chance it might've had for worthy inclusion on a future edition of Guitar Hero. (Note to Activision: I am totally cool with requisite QOTSA singles ""No One Knows"" or ""3's and 7's"" bringing the rock fury and carpal tunnel.)
The most enjoyable moments on Era Vulgaris come when the band treads off the beaten path. One of the album's standout tracks, ""Make It Wit Chu"", is a straight-forward blues-rock number plucked from the last Desert Sessions disc.  And the album's gentler digressions, like the guitar-weeping ""Into the Hollow"" and the mournful ""Suture Up Your Future"", reveal Homme has a surprisingly palatable softer side. ""Turning on the Screw"" and ""I'm Designer"" aren't exactly groundbreaking departures from the QOTSA's usual fare, but Homme's lyrical bent adds an interesting wrinkle. No one's going to confuse him with Bob Dylan any time this century, but you could put much worse in your mouth than lines like, ""My generation's for sale/ Beats a steady job/ How much have you got?"" or, ""You can't lose it if you never had it/ Disappear man, do some magic."" It's at points like these when Era Vulgaris truly comes to life. Unfortunately for listeners, those moments are few and far between, leaving fans to trudge back to older Queens records for the fix they crave.",2007-06-11T06:00:01,['Rock'],6.2,Interscope,Queens of the Stone Age: Era Vulgaris Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10327-era-vulgaris/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2007-06-11,-4.316438356164384,2007.25,0.0
16,Worlds,['Porter Robinson'],"The North Carolina producer's shimmering, saccharine-sweet new album comes off like a mix of Passion Pit and M83. Guests include Amy Millan of Stars.
If Porter Robinson didn’t make an album like Worlds in 2014, someone else would have. Never mind that, if one were to squint real hard, the North Carolina producer’s shimmering, saccharine-sweet new album could be seen as an antidote to the aggressive, toxically masculine culture that’s pervaded mainstream American dance culture over the last few years—a culture whose fuck-it sense of hedonism has recently resulted in fatal consequences, even as its corporate benefactors continue to cynically bleed its participants dry. Much more than a corrective gesture, the specific mix of sounds on Worlds—part synthy indie-pop, part twinkling bedroom-beatmaker fare, part festival-ready electro—comes at an excellent time. Finding a middle ground between the synthetic surge of big-tent dance music and the tart melodic tendencies of Passion Pit, Robinson’s debut album drives home the reality that mainstream electronic music carries a certain sensitivity found in chart-topping smashes, zeitgeist-capturing Ultra Fest main-stagers, and sneakily successful soft-beat auteurs alike.
Viewed through this lens, the mess of contradictions that Robinson seemingly embodies—a one-time bassface junkie who loaded his recent BBC Essential Mix with cloying indie fare, a dance superstar who’s expressed disgust regarding his own Las Vegas residency while pooh-poohing “DIY Brooklyn” and “future bass” in the same breath—untangles itself. And anyway, the expansive, wistful grandeur of Worlds is a sound that Robinson’s slowly built towards over the last few years. A practical Skrillex protegé raised, like many internet denizens, on a diet of video games and the nerdier areas of Japanese culture, Robinson’s transformation into a sky-gazing sentimentalist began not with his Beatport-crashing 2011 debut EP Spitfire, but the following year’s “Language”, a swooning single that packed shoegaze’s heady throb, American dubstep’s techy crunch, and the wistfulness of trance into six minutes-plus of bliss that slightly resembled if Tiësto had remixed the Honeydrips’ “Fall From a Height” instead of the Field.
If “Language” toyed with the idea of pushing American dance music trends into a more blissed-out direction, Worlds goes whole-hog, to the point that when buzzsaw synths, chintzy strings, and nasty basslines rear their heads near the album’s end on “Fellow Feeling”, their presence is garish and unwelcome. If we’re being real, it’s hard to justify calling most of Worlds “dance music,” as this is electro-pop plain and simple, with its guest vocalists—Stars’ Amy Millan, Owl City affiliate Breanne Duren, Canadian indie-pop duo Imaginary Cities, Sean Caskey of Australian festival-poppers Last Dinosaurs—embodying that genre’s sensibilities. Most surprisingly, Robinson himself occasionally and quite effectively takes lead vocal duties, especially on “Sad Machine”, which finds his high-range voice dueting with a Vocaloid, a digital audio tool that replicates the human voice, over a mid-tempo beat and starry-eyed melodic structure.
”Sad Machine” is one of a few tracks on Worlds that evoke, unintentionally or not, Passion Pit’s high-wire synth-pop fantasias. But above all else, the equally enduring influence of M83’s emotive electro looms over this album’s highlights. “Sea of Voices” stretches out elided vocals and fizzling ambience to an impossibly gorgeous zenith, before massive drums crash through the foreground in a manner not unlike “My Tears Are Becoming a Sea”, from M83’s still-unbeatable 2011 opus Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming; on “Hear the Bells”, a similar trick is played to equally ecstatic effect, the processing on Imaginary Cities’ vocals serving as a minor and unnecessary distraction from the rippling electronics and anthemic synth that gives the song a healthy, balanced dose of rocket fuel. Together, “Hear the Bells” and “Sea of Voices” make for two of the most transportive electro-pop singles of this year, a pair of unabashedly huge songs that, when caught in the right light, carry the potential to strike a personal chord for anyone who’s ever felt alive while looking at a city skyline at night.
The main drawback to Worlds’ sound, an impressionistic approach to mass-appeal fare, is that anyone with their ear to the (festival) ground might find these sounds to be relatively old-hat—after all, Passion Pit’s suffered a legion of imitators in their wake, and “Midnight City” has proved one of the most influential songs of the decade when it comes to guiding the tastes of major-label-signed, small-font-Coachella-poster acts. So no one’s going to refer to Worlds as “innovative”, and the sonic shift Robinson’s made here is as industry-canny as it is surprising. Regardless, the career transition he’s attempting is admirable and extremely promising, even of his peers don’t follow suit—and if they do, they certainly could use the change of pace.",2014-08-11T06:00:01,['Electronic'],6.9,Astralwerks,Porter Robinson: Worlds Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19517-porter-robinson-worlds/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2014-08-11,2.856164383561644,2014.5,0.0
17,English Electric,['Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark'],"Incorporating references to Kraftwerk, Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach, and their own classic back catalogue, the British new wave band OMD's second album since reforming in 2006 features a tension between the past and a possible way forward.
From the late 1970s onward, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were as much reacting to the sonic possibilities made available by technology as they were translating them, first as increasingly popular hit-makers at home and Europe, then with a clutch of memorable American singles. English Electric, the British new wave band's second full length since the reformation of the classic 1980s lineup in 2006, neither escapes from the quartet's past nor fully aims to. Afterall, they had Peter Saville do their cover art, just has he did for their debut 33 years ago.
In that regard, much of English Electric inititally seems like a recapitulation. The first full song on the album, “Metroland”, starts out aping the opening melody and sonics of Kraftwerk’s “Europe Endless”, then goes as far as to include a riff on the wordless chorale vocals, too. But the punching beat of the song feels more post-industrial, suggesting the relentless pulse underlying later groups like VNV Nation or Apoptygma Berzerk. That, and frontman Andy McCluskey's immediately recognizable singing, above all else, provides the melodic focus as well as the elegant, yearning tone, here and throughout.
As the album title indicates clearly enough, it's a reflective English futurism, perhaps, in the same way that a group like Pink Floyd often provided a certain rainy day psychedelia that could have only derived from Great Britain and nowhere else. That English Electric itself was the name of a noted UK train and aerospace manufacturing firm from the 20th Century further underscores that sense of a specifically grounded and gone past, no less so than Kraftwerk had its own earlier obsessions with a German and Middle European technology already confronting an obsolescence.
Yet for all the backward glancing, there's a tension between the past and a possible way forward. “Kissing the Machine”, perhaps one of the clearest moments of a returned past, is a reworking of a song McCluskey did with Kraftwerk veteran Karl Bartos two decades back for the latter’s Elektric Music project. Meanwhile, McCluskey has noted in a recent interview that “Decimal” is meant to capture a feeling from Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach, while the song “Helen of Troy” in its stately passion, sweet hookiness, and the title itself, captures the feeling of “Joan of Arc” and “Maid of Orleans”.
If there's something key, though, it's that all of this doesn't truly feel like their past redone in exactly the same way-- polished and punchier, not quite as nervously trebly, able to suggest the aggressiveness of EBM on the arrangement of something like “Our System” but not replicating it. In that regard the airport PA-styled announcement of “The future that you anticipated has been cancelled” from the opening “Please Remain Seated” turns out to be more apt than might be guessed -- it’s neither the tentative beginnings nor the top 40 pomp, but something else again.
This balancing of tensions may be the secret of English Electric’s overall appeal. If a band like Radiohead transformed the technological perceptions and considered unease of OMD’s still astonishing early 80s masterpiece Dazzle Ships into their own fractured electronic nightmares, OMD are secure enough in their own sound and vision to create a “Fitter Happier” kissing cousin in the glitch-tinged and robotic-voiced “Atomic Ranch” without sounding a mere borrowing back. “The Future Will Be Silent"" crackles with suggestions of bass drops and intrusive noise, fractures and slows and weaves among a cascade of sound. “The future was not supposed to be like this,” a treated voice repeats at several points, but OMD continue to stake out their retrofuturism on their terms, a roots jam for a generation raised on wires.",2013-04-11T06:00:01,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",6.7,BMG,Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark: English Electric Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17843-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-english-electric/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2013-04-11,1.521917808219178,2013.25,0.0
18,I Am Easy to Find,['The National'],"With a cast of female vocalists guiding and redirecting the songs, the National’s eighth album is their largest, longest, and most daring.
There’s a lot to marvel at on any National album: the regality, the musicianship, the compositional flourishes, the ornate displays of sublimated rage. The ex-Brooklynites are among the smallest handful of ’00s bands to close out the ’10s with a higher stock than what they entered with; theirs is one of the richest dynamics in indie rock. But for all they’re good at, every album has been first and foremost a litmus test on singer Matt Berninger. To enjoy the National, you’ve got to enjoy him.
Anybody who’s followed the band for seven albums has likely done so because they’ve connected with Berninger’s dapper hangdog persona, a Cary Grant interpretation of Leonard Cohen. He’s the kind of singer who can express listeners’ ugliest insecurities yet somehow make them sound like a brag, forever the star of his own movie where not much happens but it’s all beautifully shot. It’s a real feat spinning a fantasy out of feelings so messy. Even for listeners growing tired of his grousing voiceovers, or those who never liked it much to begin with, the band’s form-breaking eighth album I Am Easy To Find offers another way in. For the first time, Berninger is just a piece of this universe, not the center.
On nearly every song Berninger is accompanied and sometimes silenced by a rotation of featured female vocalists who step in to offer perspective, commentary, and dissent. It’s perhaps yet another lesson internalized from Cohen, whose songs regularly called on a chorus of women as their voice of reason. And like Cohen, the National have recruited some of the best singers out, among them Lisa Hannigan, Mina Tindle, Kate Stables, Sharon Van Etten, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, whose spotlight “Dust Swirls in Strange Light” benches Berninger all together. Most revelatory of all is Gail Ann Dorsey, David Bowie’s longtime bassist and backing singer, who heralds the album’s new direction midway through opener “You Had Your Soul With You.” Her extraordinary voice of saffron arrives like a divine intervention, instantly parting a track that had previously been National-by-numbers.
The album’s guest roster shores up the National’s greatest critical vulnerability—the myopic white, male vantage—so conveniently that it’s tempting to read it as cynical. In interviews, the band has been more than a little defensive about the choice, insisting it wasn’t made out of some patronizing notion of allyship. It’s the execution, though, that casts aside doubts. These women aren’t window dressing, they’re focal points, and each subtly redirects the music to previously unexplored directions. They approach these songs from the most daring angles of attack, creating an air of unpredictability that even 2017’s electronics-laced Sleep Well Beast couldn’t sustain. Their presence also turns the lyrics, some written by Berninger’s wife Carin Besser, from a monologue into a conversation. The competing perspectives seem to humble the singer, challenging him and shaking him from his own head. “I know I can get attached and then unattached to my own versions of others,” he concedes on “The Pull of You.”
All those outside voices aren’t the only reason I Am Easy To Find can feel like a remix of a National album. Just as those strong collaborators seize the control away from the band, so has the record’s producer Mike Mills, a director by trade who incorporated some of this music into a tear-jerking short film of the same name. In the band’s telling, Mills wasn’t shy about editing their work, often stripping songs of the elements the band was most excited about (that may be why so few of Sleep Well Beasts’ U2-isms have carried through). So although the album is the band’s biggest yet, with a cast of dozens including 13 violinists alone, it rarely feels bulky. Only the too-Arcade-Fire-for-comfort “Where Is Her Head” succumbs to grandiosity, prioritizing spectacle over purpose.
At 64 minutes, I Am Easy To Find is also the National’s longest album, which is a mixed blessing. It provides room to luxuriate and admire all these guest voices as the art pieces they are while getting sucked into unhurried treasures like “Quiet Light” and “Oblivions,” both among the band’s most weightless and sublime. But the record can drag, sometimes badly. “Rylan” sounds like a rewrite of every other mid-tempo National number directed at a character with a moderately memorable name, while “Hairpin Turns” adds ammunition the most frequent dismissal of this band: They’re boring.
The complementary inverse of boring, of course, is consistent, an adjective that’s similarly dogged this band for the last decade (it’s meant as praise, but more often reads as shorthand for nothing new to see here). Between the consecutive departures of Sleep Well Beast and I Am Easy To Find, the band has finally started pushing back against their reputation for playing it safe. If some of their gambits sound less risky than they actually are, it’s mostly because they’ve pulled them off so well.
I Am Easy To Find’s lyrics, too, celebrate risk. On “Not In Kansas,” Berninger fears that he may not be the type of guy to punch a Nazi, though he’d love to be. And while the album’s title sentiment could be read as romantic in a certain light—a sweet reassurance—the title track instead casts it as a passionless pledge between a couple too tired to fight but too vested to split. The words reek of defeat; there’s nothing alluring about them. In contrast, on “Hey Rosey,” Gail Ann Dorsey outlines a far more dangerous love, one like a razor blade and a radiant flame, and Berninger can barely contain his excitement. “There’s never really any safety in it!” he swoons, as the music crests and trembles deliriously. In love, as in art, easy is boring. The unknown? Now that he can get worked up about.",2019-05-16T05:00:00,['Rock'],7.6,4AD,The National: I Am Easy to Find Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-national-i-am-easy-to-find/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2019-05-16,7.620547945205479,2019.25,0.0
19,Outer Heaven,['Greys'],"The ferocious noise-punk quartet Greys redirects indie rock's inward gaze back out into the wider world.
For the past five Halloweens, Toronto has played host to Death to T.O., a marathon two-level party where 20-odd local bands dress up as some iconic group and cover a bunch of their songs in rotating 20-minute mini-sets. Last October, noise-punk quartet Greys performed as Smashing Pumpkins, a ruse that required not just an aesthetic suspension of belief (no dollar-store blond wig can make hulking bassist Colin Gillespie look like D'Arcy) but an ideological one as well. Essentially, the Pumpkins are Greys' polar opposites. Where Billy Corgan channels themes of alienation into unabashedly earnest, immaculately rendered grunge-prog, Greys power through theirs with bull-in-a-china-shop recklessness and snarky humor. And the messianic cult of personality and gothic flamboyance that Corgan so eagerly cultivates is antithetical to Greys' everyman, stage-leveling ethos. After all, Greys are the sort of band that write songs in honour of Fugazi's Guy Picciotto, while cheekily acknowledging that idolizing an anti-rock star like Picciotto is idolatry nonetheless (""You do what you do/ I do it, too!"").
But listen to Greys' second full-length, Outer Heaven, and that Pumpkins gambit seems less like a one-off goof than a practice drill for the new album's fearless embrace of both art-rock experimentalism and pop accessibility. When they first emerged in 2011, Greys came off like a less brawny, more bratty complement to fellow Toronto-scene stalwarts Metz. Singer-guitarist Shehzaad Jiwani didn't necessarily shy away from melodic choruses and introspective lyricism, but he had to blow out his vocal cords to be heard amid the band's Jehu-schooled, post-hardcore pummel. And the feelings of inadequacy he was trying to express were filtered through cheeky song titles (see: ""Use Your Delusion"") and tongue-in-cheek complaints (""Wish I was born in New York, wish I was born in L.A., wish I was born in the royal family""). But with the tranquil, starlit jangle of the opening ""Cruelty,"" Outer Heaven marks a clean, abrupt break from that past—not just by opening up greater spatial possibilities in the band's sound world, but by foregrounding a nakedly emotional tenor that permeates even the more typically ferocious tracks that follow.
Like many ’90s kids, Greys got swept up in the alt-rock revolution, before burrowing deeper underground to discover the self-sustaining network of bands and labels that laid the groundwork for it. (That evolution can be traced from the fact the aforementioned song about Picciotto swipes its opening line from the Foo Fighters: ""There goes my hero!/ He lives right down the street!"") Now that ""indie"" has become a satellite-radio format for well-heeled commuters, it's hard to remember a time when such a discovery could be so empowering that it could alter the course of one's life. But guitar-driven indie rock's deliberately modest scale and often introverted, sometimes ironic sensibility can make it ill-equipped to address the more complex socio-political conversations that dominate our thoughts today; at a time when the top pop stars of our age are tackling big issues head on, the insular nature of indie rock can seem antiquated at best and tone-deaf at worst. For those raised to believe in indie-rock's insurrectionary spirit, it's easy to feel like you were sold a false bill of goods—a music that once seemed absolutely revolutionary now reeks of complacency and privilege.
Jiwani is a unique position to reconcile this divide. He's of South Asian descent, which makes him a minority amid a scene that's predominantly white even in a city as famously multicultural as Toronto. So you could say his relationship with indie rock is complicated, and that tension comes to a head on Outer Heaven's delirious mid-album highlight, ""Complaint Rock."" Jiwani gamely assumes the role of a slack motherfucker (""gimme gimme my gold star/ for not trying so hard""), before summing up his chosen vocation with a two-faced cry of ""I hate it!/ I want it!/ I need it! /I love it!"" That conflict is as much musical as lyrical: partway through, the song's glass-smashing abandon gives way to a gentle waves of rippling, psychedelic guitars—as if Jiwani suddenly slipped into a spa isolation-tank treatment mid-song—before it's violently thrust back into attack mode for a final blitz. And that push-pull structure presents a perfect microcosm of Greys' larger mission—as easy as it is to complain about the state of indie rock and check out of the conversation, they feel compelled to stay in the game to get the job done right.
On Outer Heaven, that means redirecting indie rock's capacity for introspection and turning its gaze outward. In the past, Jiwani has expressed feelings of otherness in more generally misanthropic terms (""wish I could be somebody else and just go,"" he declared back on ""Use Your Delusion""), but Outer Heaven's searing, slow-boiling salvo ""No Star"" sees him tackling matters of race in more explicit terms: ""Don't shoot/ I'm not the enemy,"" he sings, giving voice to anxieties in the wake of last fall's Paris attacks and the subsequent bloodlusty calls for swift vengeance. And when you consider that he routinely gets the third-degree treatment from airport security, the harsh opening line of the industrialized stomper ""Sorcerer""—""My body makes me sick/ I'm trapped inside my skin""—assumes an even more brutal resonance. But the songs here also touch on more universal, but often documented, situations: ""Blown Out"" chronicles the effects of depression on a romantic relationship, the song's thundering thrust and surging choruses mirroring the inner turmoil of someone who's ""having a hard time when everything's fine.""
Outer Heaven's heightened ambitions are best measured in terms of density rather than sprawl: the most bracing songs here pack in more radiant guitar textures, a greater lyrical depth, and sharper hooks without sacrificing Greys' innate moshability and punk-schooled economy. Ironically, the more self-consciously outré material feels staid by comparison: the sudden grindcore shocks of ""Strange World"" can't quite force the song to shake off its dirgey gait, and though the drum machine-ticked ""My Life As a Cloud"" taps into the spectral beauty of Halcyon Digest-era Deerhunter, its trickling guitar outro closes this highly charged album on an oddly resigned note. But even if Greys are still learning how to stretch out with purpose, Outer Heaven serves as a most welcome reminder of indie rock's iconoclastic potential, from a band committed to the belief that it could be your life.",2016-04-13T05:00:00,['Rock'],7.8,Carpark,Greys: Outer Heaven Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21716-outer-heaven/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2016-04-13,4.53013698630137,2016.25,0.0
20,Movement,['Gossip'],"I'm supposing anyone who's read even a couple lines about this Arkansas-born, Olympia-based trio must know that their ...
I'm supposing anyone who's read even a couple lines about this Arkansas-born, Olympia-based trio must know that their not-so-secret weapon is 22-year-old front-woman Beth Ditto, whose blistering, blues-reeling yowl has established some goddamn fully realized roots for the band's punk-inflected garage rock. It's Ditto who pushes the Gossip above the majority of their genre's not-so-great, middling pretenders. You need go no further than ""Nite"", the grinding opener on their second full-length Movement, to realize these shaggy, Ramones-loving stylistics are channel surfing Etta James, Janis Joplin, Bessie Smith, and dusty country roads-- not Nina Hagen, like so much of the pack. Ozark garage rock! Queer-positive Leadbelly!
My adoration isx92t unadulterated. I do indeed like dirty, swaggering music, but beyond Ditto's substantial vocal prowess, the band doesn't often push the artistic envelope. I'm not stubbornly naïve enough to think every band needs to pull out the analog tape-loop machine and KK Null back catalogue, but when these guys opt to compliment Ditto's voice by swerving left and experimenting with their relatively bare instrumentation, the off-kilter results raise the band's output to a different level of sweet-home goodness. Conversely, when they stick hard and fast to standard formations, these enfant terribles lose steam and dissolve inertly into to the white-striped background.
I grew up wearing a Royal Trux t-shirt and playing drums in a shaky teenage band that covered Flipper's ""Sex Bomb"". Ever since I was that high-school chump with a confused head for taking apart instruments, I knew half the battle with my beloved genre was overcoming similarity. The essential aspect of seminal noise-fuck bands like Pussy Galore and Royal Trux was a preternatural ability to incorporate punk and art-rock into standard 1960's garage and a lifetime of cribbed rhythm and blues. Sadly, at this point, even one side of Dial M For Motherfucker or Twin Infinitives still out-punches the entire oeuvres of so many of today's well-dressed hacks.
I'm blabbering about composition because the cracks in the Gossip's straightforward sheen point toward a previously unseen horizon splattered orange, pink, and dark purple. What if they upped their already substantial ante by making their work more patchwork? Ditto's vocal acrobatics tank when the music behind her doesn't progress from Olympia style bass-less guitar mush backed by primitive drums. When you rely on one guitar you should take a nod from Mecca Normal: develop a mile-high stack of riffs. As of now, I'm left picking at guitar god scraps.
Movement's best moments are transitions: the slice of guitar noise at the end of the beautifully distraught ""Yesterday's News""; ""Gone"" becomes an unaccompanied hand-clap sing-a-long at its coda, transforming the track into a wonderfully anonymous punk-rock spiritual; after a pause at the end of ""Light Light Sleep"", a repetitive guitar chops it up, and Ditto's notes explode, taking flight. Though there are only a few of these shifts in recording textures and gradations, these glitches in tonal quality impart a beautiful dissymmetry to the sermon, adding a muddy Tower Recordings underbelly to the band's approach.
The Gossip sound best when flowing through lo-fi constraints: when they dox92t have a hi-hat, and the down-tuned guitar is missing string. When the music's boxier, Ditto's voice soars; when the guitar and bass evoke a boom-box recording, the muck of the dank room warps into a golden treasure trove. In the spirit of shitty recordings, I look forward to their upcoming live release on Dim Mak, which was culled from Non-Dead In NYC (a cassette the band ran only 50 copies of themselves). Maybe they could use that raw tape hiss and a razor blade to create a complexly recalibrated remix album?
Whatever. Even if my experimental pipe dream doesx92t come to fruition, I really like it when people make music out of junk, and the Gossip do indeed concoct boozy sun-drunk music, its rust mined from anthills, rising rivers, dirty lemonade, and the brassy patches of grass in a broken southern sidewalk. I just wish the soul was as fractured.",2003-06-18T05:00:01,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",7.8,Kill Rock Stars,Gossip: Movement Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3534-movement/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2003-06-18,-8.3,2003.25,0.0
21,Trilogy,['The Weeknd'],"Best new reissue
This set gathers the three 2011 mixtapes from Toronto R&B singer Abel Tefsaye and adds three new songs along with new mixes and mastering. Trilogy as a whole sets up a narrative that was previously only implied and has more force when heard in this form.
If you checked out completely in 2011, Trilogy has all the makings of a blockbuster: 22-year old Toronto native Abel Tefsaye along with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney developed a state-of-the-art R&B template and scored several radio hits; they're associates of megastar Drake, and have played sold-out club shows and rapturously received festival appearances. But there's one catch: If you weren't checked out completely during 2011, you've already heard the vast majority of Trilogy, for free. So it's understandable if you're wondering why this set, which collects the Weeknd's three 2011 mixtapes in one package and adds three additional songs, exists in the first place. But presentation matters to the Weeknd. This is evident in the project's early anonymity, the unified typography, the striking photographs, the ambitious videos and, most important, the fact that Tesfaye called his three releases of 2011 a trilogy. It's not unprecedented for someone to put out three albums in a year, but Trilogy suggests an ambitious and rigorously planned Work of Art.
While the previously available versions of House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence already felt definitive, a three-hour immersion provides a new way in, assuming you are willing to take it as a single piece. Which isn't easy: in spite of Tesfaye's diaphanous voice and the lush production, these are heavy records, with tempos that slow to a codeine drip for five minutes or more. But Trilogy as a whole sets up a narrative that was previously only implied.
House of Balloons is the ""fun"" part of the story, though that's a relative term. It has the only Weeknd songs you might play at a celebration, and the only point where the illicit behavior feels alluring. On House, the Weeknd introduce an aesthetic that, over the course of the rest of the three tapes, gradually evolves into something deeper and less based in traditional songcraft. It's a continuation of the purple-tinted R&B and hip-hop hybrid forged by The-Dream and Drake, with eye-of-the-quiet storm assurance of Sade and Aaliyah and industrial and trip-hop touches that range from Nine Inch Nails to Tricky. But the Weeknd show a flair for melody that allows every richly atmospheric song on House to stand on its own, boasting strong (and sometimes borrowed) hooks that embrace repetition without feeling manipulative. The cyclical choruses of ""What You Need"", ""The Morning"", and ""High For This"" in particular are both immediately striking and subtly ingratiating, overtures to pop radio that operate outside of it.
Those borrowed hooks mean that House of Balloons is the part of Trilogy most affected by the remaster. If you can't catch how the guitars hit a little harder and the drums have a bit more pop on ""High For This"", you'll definitely notice how the sample from Aaliyah's ""Rock the Boat"" has been wiped from ""What You Need"". If I had to choose, I prefer the original House of Balloons for its spontaneity, but it's kind of like familiarizing yourself with your partner after they get a new haircut; it's just different for a while, and if you want, you can always go back.
Thursday is exactly the kind of ""difficult"" second record you'd expect from the Weeknd had they disappeared for two years and holed up in the studio as a reaction to House's success. But it came just a few months after. It's more ambitious in its way, incorporating influences far from the R&B mainstream and generally just sounding like it has something to prove.
The title is a loaded metaphor; Thursday is a day for the most dedicated partiers, the one that separates a lost weekend from a week full of blackouts. Accordingly, the album is an hour-long exploration of people acknowledging a point of no return. What had been seductive has become menacing. Outside of Drake's guest verse on ""The Zone"", there's not much indication that the songs take place in a club of any sort. The pleasure on House of Balloons felt consensual; here, it feels codependent.
Echoes of Silence benefits considerably from the Trilogy context and now seems on equal footing with House of Balloons and Thursday. As Juicy J helpfully reminds us out of nowhere at the end of ""Same Old Song"", Echoes was released near Christmas, a refractory period between the publication of year-end lists and the turn of the calendar. It's easy to overlook new music that drops at that point, especially in this case, where the lack of immediate hooks suggests that it could have been a rush job.
But get familiar with Echoes' aims and you can hear its value. For one, the lyrical and thematic callbacks make clear that Echoes was meant to interact with what preceded it, to serve as an epilogue and appendix in addition to a denouement. More importantly, it's easier to tune into the final third's resounding depression after having been tenderized by the preceding two hours. It's a morning-after record for a night that never ended, where people have to go into their day shift with no sleep, where club stars still live with parents and the parents find drugs in the laundry. And it's where people who only hours before were perfectly fine to snort their life away simply cannot fucking stand to be around each other for another minute.
But the arresting music redeems that potentially alienating emotional view. ""Montreal"" boasts a frigid and concise hurt as well as a pop sensibility that went missing from the previous half hour, ""Outside"" incorporates intriguing Eastern overtones, and ""The Fall"" integrates Clams Casino's brand of beautifully wasted hip-hop, which ascended in parallel to the Weeknd throughout 2011.
On House's ""The Party and the After Party,"" Tefsaye sings, ""They don't want my love/ They just want my potential."" In the context of Trilogy's progression, it's the first crack in his callous exterior, revealing a lifelong studio nerd with possibly years worth of grudges (""I don't play/ Unless it's keys and I play all day,"" he claims on ""Loft Music""). He makes repeated mentions of ""potential,"" and being ""next,"" fixating on those particular words like he's holding onto something a girl told him in 7th grade. If you turn your ear right, Trilogy is the most in-depth exploration of male sexual neuroses this side of Pinkerton.
""You never thought I'd go this far,"" Tesfaye sings on ""Same Old Song"". That line could be a reference to marathon drug use or the progressive demoralization of his narrator, which bottoms out amidst the pall of gang rape coursing through the very uncomfortable ""Initiation"". The inclusion of Michael Jackson's venomous ""Dirty Diana"" on Echoes (renamed ""D.D."") is perfect in this context, retaining the original's deplorable depiction of predatory groupies as the feminine norm. Tesfaye's narrator celebrates his own irresistibility and embraces the poisonous justifications of victimhood.
Just as perfect is the closing title track, which finds Tesfaye alone in a quiet room, letting the past reverberate, hitting bottom because he simply stops digging. It's the point where the Weeknd's 2011 stops and it's a perfect way to end things. At least it was; on Trilogy, it's followed by ""Till Dawn (Here Comes The Sun)"". Like all of the new songs, it's strong enough on its own but arbitrary in terms of sequencing and has only minimal relation to the LP it was included on.
This is some of the best music of the young decade; judging by its already pervasive influence, it's safe to say Trilogy (or at least House of Balloons) will be one of those records that will be viewed as a turning point when we look at the 2010s as a whole. Some of it's up to demographics. Artists of Tesfaye's age had formative years where Timbaland, the Neptunes, Missy Elliott, D'Angelo, and Aaliyah were at the peak of their powers. And given the ""new rock revolution"" early in the 2000's, which created nothing new at all, it stands to reason that many who came of age in that era don't hear rock as a progressive form. You can sense the shift when talking to new bands. And of course, for those who have some indie rock inclinations, Beach House and Siouxsie samples don't hurt.
Ultimately, the Weeknd's music creates a world. In it, people acknowledge their humanity as expressed by their desires to fuck, to get high, to resent one another, to hurt, to not care about tomorrow. That's a lot for a single artist to take on. ""You'll wanna be high for this,"" Tesfaye memorably sings within the first minute. Trilogy's triumph is in how it makes its three hours feel necessary to fully embrace it all, to acknowledge its existence inside ourselves and to vicariously live through it as art.",2012-11-13T06:00:00,['Pop/R&B'],8.5,Universal Republic,The Weeknd: Trilogy Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17280-the-trilogy/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2012-11-13,1.1136986301369862,2012.75,0.0
22,Oliver Appropriate,['Say Anything'],"In what is billed as the emo band’s farewell album, Max Bemis concocts a tangled rock opera about a burnt-out singer grappling with his rage and his sexuality.
An emo rock opera might provoke some well-deserved eye-rolls in a post-American Idiot era. But Say Anything’s Max Bemis is no stranger to the form: His 2004 cult hit, ...Is a Real Boy, for all of its goofy pop-punk hooks and lyrics about phone sex, was originally conceived as a play, right down to its producer, Hedwig and the Angry Inch writer Stephen Trask. So it’s fitting that Bemis returned to the format for the band’s final record, Oliver Appropriate. For Say Anything, the outlandish nature of the stage—the heightened emotions, the unsubtle criticisms of politics and culture—lends structure to what might otherwise be unbridled hormonal rage.
And in case it has to be said about a man who frequently screams “I hate everyone” on stage, Bemis has rage in spades. Enough rage for a nine-page screed ahead of their final record. Enough rage for a double-album about mid-aughts emo. Enough rage for a line like, “You are a vacuous soldier of the thrift-store Gestapo.” On Oliver Appropriate, he channels his rage into Oliver, the album’s protagonist, a suspiciously familiar “singer of a burnt-out emo/indie punk band past their peak,” as he put it in the record’s manifesto. But this dissonance between “Max” and “Oliver” means that Bemis, finally, can write about himself without really writing about himself. It means that Oliver—who’s also described as “the bastard son of Columbine” and “a thinly veiled critique of new age masculinity”—could really be any beanie-wearing dude doing mental backflips to reconcile his sexual proclivities with his self-image.
The 14 songs on Oliver Appropriate detail two days in the life of this prototypical millennial with the specificity of a good script, down to the scene-setting he sings on album opener “The Band Fuel”: “The dream of Julian Casablancas, gyro salesmen and a stranger in my blankets. Awoken by Amazon Drones.” As has become tradition, the record also includes its fair share of digs at his fellow failed indie musicians—“I know a lot of men in hardcore bands who collectively fund the Colombians,” he sneers on “Pink Snot.”
But all of this score-settling is really a bait-and-switch for the crux of the album, a sexual confrontation that finds seemingly straight Oliver/Max confusingly in love with a man. Bemis himself came out as bisexual in 2018. Max dealt with it by writing this record. Oliver deals with it by slitting his lover’s throat.
Don’t be surprised, though, if you miss that morbid detail upon first listen. It’s a tossed off line—“I’ll slit your throat and leave you gaping”—that seems commonplace in a discography full of macabre lyrics sung with the pithy delivery of mediocre karaoke. The undertones of sexual confusion, made explicit in Bemis’ manifesto, are only briefly mentioned in the record itself. The most frank discussion of Oliver’s internalized, violent homophobia is on “Your Father,” a song about parental disapproval sung, somewhat ironically, by a man and a woman, neither of which are Bemis (creative partner Karl Kuehn and Bemis’ wife Sherri DuPree, respectively). Without the context that Bemis’ personal life and highly detailed essay provide, the record’s plotline is muddied and morally ambiguous at best.
But in its sharpest moments, it is exciting to see Bemis really wrestle with himself again. Over the past decade, Say Anything slowly lost their lyrical might; their words still cut, but the blade was dull. By contrast, Oliver Appropriate is almost uncomfortably rich with verbose specificity, from the Paul Walker movies Oliver half-watches with a girl to the excuses he makes for his shitty behavior post-hookup: “Bowie’s my excuse so I can brag of how I tried, when all I want to do is send you off and get you high,” he sings on “Send You Off.” It’s hackneyed at times (lines about rock stars who “ramble about Trump over Stellas and headline Coachella” are dusty disses), but the record showcases the dark humor and narrative knack that set the band apart on ...Is a Real Boy.
It’s refreshing to hear guitar on a Say Anything album after half a decade of the token failed experiments of latter-day emo (a “hip hop” record, an attempt at piano-driven ballads). The acoustic guitar, recorded so closely that you can hear the textured abrasion of fingertips against nylon, sounds romantic and nostalgic next to Bemis’ shredded whine on songs like “Daze.” Say Anything’s contemporaries from the mid-2000s are remembered as a series of slick pop-punk bands mixed into oblivion. But Oliver Appropriate, with its clap-along drumming patterns and stripped-back production, sounds like an elder statesman of emo gathering his fellow washed up frontmen around a campfire for a story or two. It’s a fitting ending for a band that always stood a step or two outside the scene, pointing and laughing.",2019-01-25T06:00:00,['Rock'],6.5,Dine Alone,Say Anything: Oliver Appropriate Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/say-anything-oliver-appropriate/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2019-01-25,7.316438356164384,2019.0,0.0
23,B-Room,['Dr. Dog'],"Dr. Dog attempted a complete overhaul for their seventh full-length, B-Room. The Philadelphia rock band started from the ground up, building a new studio and living quarters and, for the first time, they tracked everything live.
""I don't ever want to go back to the old days,"" sings Dr. Dog's Scott McMicken on ""My Old Ways"", a song off 2007's We All Belong. They're kind of ironic lyrics coming from a band that keeps scraping the bottom of a barrel of older influences—the Beach Boys, the Band, the Faces, the Dead, CSNY for good measure, Captain Beefheart in interviews. And yet, it's a fitting personal statement considering Carl Wilson's recent evaluation of another critically panned, fan-beloved outfit: Mumford & Sons. Quoting Chuck Eddy, Wilson wrote, ""The Mumfords barely skim the surface. They don't seem remotely musically curious."" The same can be said of Dr. Dog, which has rarely made music with any real sense of urgency or ambition, much less curiosity about their predecessors. (In related news, Dr. Dog is currently touring with the Lumineers.)
To their credit, Dr. Dog did attempt an overhaul for their seventh full-length, B-Room. The band started from the ground up, building a new studio and living quarters in an abandoned silversmith factory in their hometown of Philadelphia. They recorded B-Room in the studio space they named it after, for the first time taking advantage of their strengths as performers and tracking everything live. The difference is subtle at best, but their decision not to complicate things with overdubs contributed to the refreshing straightforwardness of a few songs, including their sparest yet, ""Too Weak to Ramble"". Over an acoustic guitar, co-vocalist Toby Leaman sings so ragged you can practically hear the walls of the B-room, and his life, closing in around him. ""Broken Heart"" is another lesson in restraint, straying from its tight, chugging clip for only the most emphatic of Dr. Dog's signature jaw-popping harmonies.
But it's still hard for Dr. Dog to break out of their decade-plus mold. The closest anyone came was on 2010's Shame, Shame, arguably their strongest effort to date. Producer Rob Schnapf (Islands, Elliott Smith) and guest vocalist Jim James helped buff the band's motley mass appeal until it shone through the album's brassy builds and sing-along choruses, utilizing the energy of six musicians to the fullest. Without outside direction, however, Dr. Dog quickly go back to their old ways. Afrobeat specialists Antibalas provide the horns on B-Room, but their talents are wasted on songs like ""Long Way Down"", the beginning of which sounds like the Wayne's World dissolve tuned to a baritone sax. It shows some musical curiosity on Dr. Dog's part, for sure, but the track references Be the Void's heavy-handed experimentalism—which also finds a way into the twinkly, Theremin-laced ballad ""Twilight""—more than anything else.
Around the time Be the Void came out, McMicken told the AV Club, ""Why be influenced by Dr. Dog? Why not just be influenced by the Beatles?"" Good question. There's nothing at all wrong with jamming and selling out shows and custom leather items, but if you don't believe your music adds anything to the conversation, it's fair to ask what the point is. Most music is by nature derivative, but that doesn't mean it has to be. Foxygen, for example, though much younger than Dr. Dog, manage to find ways to make the same decades-old pop and rock'n'roll new and exciting. Whether their music endures in the same way remains to be seen, but McMicken makes it sound like Dr. Dog has already given up on that possibility.

24,In Our Bedroom After the War,['Stars'],"Not out in record stores until late September, the Canadian indie pop band and its label Arts & Crafts wisely made its theatrical new album available for digital sales before it leaked.
For Canadian romantics Stars, love is war. And their modern love is strikingly similar to the world's modern war: confusion and anxiety topped with a sense of semi-staged dread. The presentation is great-- clean production, fine instrumentation, and careful arrangements-- but its undercurrent is pure self-doubt and longing. So while the quintet pushes its passion-based politics to the fore and includes the phrase ""after the war"" in the title of its fourth album, the emphasis is still ""in our bedroom."" Assuming you can dodge enough bullets to make it there.
Of course, the intricacies of relationships have always been Stars' specialty. ""I am trying to say what I want to say without having to say I love you,"" chirped co-leads Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan on 2004's minor masterpiece Set Yourself on Fire, and the line's roundabout Valentine's Day logic could double as a band mantra. What sets their new album apart from previous material is setting, scope, and a newly inflated theatrical bent. Considering his decade-spanning IMDb resume-- not to mention an award nomination for 1983's boy-meets-sea creature drama The Golden Seal-- Campbell's mannered, Moz-y vocal delivery is hardly surprising. He's a ham, plain and simple. The singer's over-the-top preening is Stars' most divisive characteristic but, instead of toning things down, his acting chops and sense of Broadway pomp permeate Bedroom's high-gloss pop more than before. And, as any Hollywood-type will tell you, an actor is only as good as his script.
Playing a pill-popping whore looking to shatter his dead-end existence on the U2-style ""Take Me to the Riot"", Campbell brings his pitiful role to life with compassion. Backed by smashing cymbals and chiming tones, his ad-libbed plea to ""let me stay, let me, let me stay!"" erases the distance between the performer and his character. The Les Mis-esque weeper ""Barricade"" doesn't fare as well: Its storyline is trite (a couple brought together-- then torn apart-- by a common, radical cause!) and, accompanied by a lone piano, there's nothing for Campbell to hide behind. But even if it approaches cheeseball bluster, at least it's sorta ballsy. Muddled by forced postmodern nonsense and an oddly lifeless narrative, ""Life 2: The Unhappy Ending"" is about as boring as its title. Ironically, though she might not possess a SAG card, Millan's dramatic abilities often trump her partner's on Bedroom-- she's more subtle and natural whether nailing the album's straight-ahead pop songs on her own or bringing out Campbell's best on a couple stand-out duets.
Both ""My Favourite Book"" and ""Bitches in Tokyo"" find Millan pining for affection in unequivocal terms. ""Book"" runs with the blind optimism of the group's indie-hit ""Ageless Beauty""-- a rare moment of guilelessness buoyed by an easy listening backdrop that would make Burt Bacharach giddy. The song provides a brief but welcome respite from the hurt and rejection surrounding it. (As if to immediately deflate the cheeriness, Millan snaps out of her rose-pedal haze with the first words of the following track: ""Sweetness never suits me."" Never say never.) ""Bitches"" isn't as dizzy-- after a plethora of ""mistakes,"" ""lying"" and ""sabotage,"" Millan can't help but beg an ex to take her back. But even with all that baggage, the singer makes a convincing case with the help of some blistering girl-group drums, piano and horns. Short and without reservation, the song avoids some of the indulgent outros and solos that tank Bedroom's lesser Millan-sung tracks including the guitar-grinding ""Window Bird"" and lethargic pep talk ""Today Will Be Better, I Swear!""
As on Set Yourself on Fire's incredible ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"", which had Campbell and Millan not just backing each other up but interacting and playing off each other in a bittersweet boy-girl tale, Bedroom's ""Midnight Coward"" and ""Personal"" take full advantage of the band's unique two-headed attack. The former is a neurotic internal analysis of that oh-so-important first-date question: Should I stay or should I go? ""I don't want to say too much,"" whispers Millan, rifling through the night's possibilities before finally joining Campbell into the unknown: ""I can see what's coming, but I'm not saying it."" On the surface, ""Personal"" is a gimmick-- a song written in personal ad parlance (""Wanted single F/ Under 33/ Must enjoy the sun/ Must enjoy the sea""). But both vocalists give the song their most impressive performances-- Campbell distant and cold, Millan vulnerable and pained-- turning its showy conceit into something genuinely wrenching. The ambiguously antiquated details emphasize its timeless central struggle: Stamped missive or Match.com, the face-to-face (dis)connection's the thing.
Growing more staged, warier, and a little less playful with age, Stars don't quite match the wily rush of Set Yourself on Fire here. After three albums of artistic quantum leaps, they slow down gracefully on Bedroom, replacing Fire's indie-symphony twists and turns with more overt dramatic airs that can fall into blubbering melodrama, e.g., the title track, which suffocates under its own ticker-tape parade epic-ness. But when they're on, Stars are one of only a few current bands that can make war seem so appealing.",2007-08-13T05:00:00,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",7.4,Arts & Crafts,Stars: In Our Bedroom After the War Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10518-in-our-bedroom-after-the-war/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2007-08-13,-4.1438356164383565,2007.5,0.0
25,Loom,['Katie Gately'],"On her second album, the L.A. musician grapples with the death of her mother, placing her playfully experimental approach to sampling and sound design in the service of a more meaningful vision.
Katie Gately’s second album wasn’t supposed to sound like this. The Los Angeles artist had nearly finished an entirely different record, with a different working title, but after receiving the devastating news that her mother had been diagnosed with a rare form of terminal cancer, Gately left that album behind.
For a while, she left her life in L.A. behind too, moving back to her family home in Brooklyn to help care for her mother. Wracked with grief and suffering from insomnia as she watched her mom slowly slip away, Gately began work on a new album, one centered around “Bracer,” a song that her mother had identified as a favorite.
Gately’s mother passed away in 2018, and Loom was finished in the months that followed. It’s an album about death, loss, and saying goodbye; it’s also the finest thing that Gately has ever done. The new LP takes a dramatic turn away from Color, her impressive 2016 full-length debut for Tri Angle. That record was a ball of kinetic energy, a collection of brightly shaded, hyperactive pop flirtations that reflected her background as a sound designer. Rapidly cycling through various moods, samples, effects, and sound palettes, Color at times sounded like Gately doing her best to express 10 different ideas simultaneously, but there was something inviting about its mania.
Loom is noticeably more focused, although it’s not without its twists and turns. Sound design still plays a major role; the LP features samples—many of them heavily manipulated—of earthquakes, screaming peacocks, howling wolves, a car crash, shaking pill bottles, a coffin closing, a shovel digging, and more. There’s even audio from her parents’ wedding. Gately’s compositional approach is just as idiosyncratic. “Bracer,” the album’s centerpiece, clocks in at more than 10 minutes and is something of a rollercoaster, opening with little more than her solemn voice and ending with a towering, grief-stricken crescendo of soaring synths and hammering percussion. Along the way, it also winds through a passage of what sounds like haunted carnival music and another movement that evokes the brooding piano lounge of bands like Black Heart Procession.
This could make for a disjointed listen, but “Bracer” (like Loom in general) has the advantage of following a very specific vision. Where Color was fueled by a playfully experimental spirit—listening to the album, it’s easy to imagine her repeatedly asking, “What would happen if I tried this?""—Loom puts her personal narrative front and center. Her production chops and intense attention to detail are still there, but they’re no longer ends in themselves; instead, they act in service of both the music’s heavy emotional core and Gately’s vocals, which have become more prominent in the mix.
It’s easy to draw comparisons between Gately and contemporaries like Zola Jesus and Holly Herndon, but on Loom her voice sounds a lot more like Kate Bush or PJ Harvey. She’s not a trained singer, but there’s a dark, bedazzling quality to her vocals; during the closing passage of “Waltz,” Gately almost seems to be channeling the famous “Song of the Witches” from Shakespeare’s Macbeth. A similar sort of necromancer vibe emanates from the swirling chorus of “Tower,” a pomp-filled song written from the perspective of her mother’s cancer medicine. Elsewhere, Gately’s voice takes on a reverent, almost religious timbre, most prominently on “Allay” and “Flow,” both of which weave her vocals into rich, soaring choirs.
Sacred music was a familiar part of Gately’s upbringing. Her mother was a former nun, and though she’d left her calling (and religion in general) after meeting Gately’s father and growing disillusioned with the Catholic church, she nonetheless filled their household with Gregorian chants and other spiritual sounds. Some of that aesthetic has clearly seeped into Loom, which contains numerous nods to religion (and her mother’s former life). Interludes “Ritual,” “Rite,” and “Rest” form a sort of devotional triptych, while “Bracer” gets a bit more literal with refrains like, “Sin sin sin sin sin for the win” and “Take my sin and shove it into yours.""
Gately has often commented on her struggles with depression and anxiety, but on Loom she sounds confident and self-assured. Her mother is all over the album, but Gately herself is the main character here, and the journey she takes is riveting. It’s her pain, her sorrow, and her memories—both good and bad—that fuel the record, and though the experience of her mother’s passing must have been harrowing, death does have a way of underlining what’s really important. Loom feels like the first time that Gateley’s technical prowess and songwriting are fully on the same page. The album may be rooted in loss, but Loom’s success lies in the clarity of vision that she has found.

26,Regifted Light,['Baby Dee'],"Former street performer continues her unusual, late-life transition into accomplished professional artist with her best LP yet. Andrew WK produces.
Baby Dee is what you might call a late bloomer. When she released her first LP, Little Window, she was already in her late forties, and her biography read like a Tom Waits song. According to a story she told NPR, she fell in love with the harp at age four after discovering the one inside an upright piano during a neighborhood piano-smashing party. Later, she often played harp in Central Park while wearing a bear costume. She had stints as a church organist and a Coney Island sideshow. Her music is an equally paradoxical blend of spiritual uplift and tin-megaphone banter.
The transition from street artist to professional has been gradual. By 2008's Safe Inside the Day, she'd learned how to make a commercial album, and her signature harp and accordion gave way to grand piano-- a more typical and versatile foundation. With her remarkable life experience now paired with recording practice, Baby Dee has made her best album yet just a couple of years shy of her 60th birthday. Idiosyncratic but ruggedly classic, Regifted Light is old-fashioned art music with a sheen of downtown grit. Dee caresses and pounds producer Andrew WK's Steinway D to life with the lyrical bluster of Gershwin and the nimble thematic development of Sondheim. It's a welcome change of pace from the post-minimalism that's rampant in indie piano music.
Opening instrumental ""Cowboys With Cowboy Hat Hair"" establishes the album's harmonic environment, making this more of a song cycle than a collection of individual pieces. Over martial snares, Dee works a theme from the C Minor scale-- light on the sharps as to lean it toward bright C Major-- up and down the keyboard. The theme rolls back and forth on itself and fractures across different octaves in odd places so that lone high notes ring out ornamentally. Regifted Light never strays too far from this tonal vicinity, which creates a unified wistfulness that Dee articulates in every shade from happy to sad. The diversity arises from Dee's inspired handling of the shallow pool of intervals-- you never know which way the themes will veer next, into upper-register dances or lower-register thunder-- and is abetted by conversational accompaniment for bassoon, cello, and glockenspiel.
Dee has an incredible voice that has drawn unavoidable comparisons to Antony Hegarty's. In fact, it is more unusual than Antony's, and more inclined toward musical theater. A little of it goes a long way, which is why it works so well appearing on just four of the 12 songs here. The scarcity gives it an outsized, mythic quality. Dee suddenly appears, utters wisdom or metaphysical fables, and vanishes into the music again. Within a single line, her voice flickers through not just different emotions, but personalities.
""The moon is my redeemer/ The moon is my befriending Jesus,"" Dee drawls on the title track, merging pagan and monotheistic traditions into a sense of human tenderness that overarches eons. The notion that with each ""regifting"" of the light, its ""gentleness increases"" could sound forced and trite in a different context, but in Dee's hands it feels at-ease and hard-won. ""Brother Slug and Sister Snail"" is a Joanna Newsom-like animal allegory where Jesus sings from the cross, ""I am a worm and not... a... MAN!"" But nobody hears him. The narrative topology is strange, but not for strangeness' sake: The elegant music bends it toward profundity.
Baby Dee tends to get written about with words like ""flamboyant"" and ""campy,"" and ""The Pie Song"" demonstrates why: Dee bashes out mad-composer chords while demanding pie with the indefinable undercurrent of menace minted by the Frogs. While ""The Pie Song"" is not representative of Regifted Light, those who want to hear the album as camp will do so, despite the fact that Dee's theatrics have been scaled back, and at any rate are not campy but piercingly sincere. The camp pigeonhole is always difficult for transgender artists to avoid in the mainstream. But Dee is simply a musician making very earnest art about a very unusual life. Regifted Light doesn't seem built to shock or cajole, but to connect with all sorts of people, and to last.",2011-03-23T06:00:02,['Rock'],8.0,Drag City,Baby Dee: Regifted Light Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15240-regifted-light/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2011-03-23,-0.5328767123287671,2011.0,0.0
27,Thin Black Duke,['Oxbow'],"Since 1989, Oxbow have been releasing some of the most eccentric heavy music albums ever. On Thin Black Duke, frontman Eugene S. Robinson wields his voice as a vehicle for disorder and transcendence.
Several months after Oxbow released their sixth album, 2007’s The Narcotic Story, frontman Eugene S. Robinson wrote a book about beating people up. It’s called Fight: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Ass-Kicking but Were Afraid You’d Get Your Ass Kicked for Asking, and it offers tips for achieving what Robinson refers to as “Zen and the Art of Kick Assertainment,” the ecstasy of sweet aches and bloody noses. The guy’s no casual sock-em-bopper: between his stints as a bouncer and a security guard, his extensive roster of martial arts skills (boxing, Kenpo karate, Muay Thai, wrestling, jiu-jitsu), and his history of choking out hecklers onstage, Robinson’s amassed a resume to rival any career pugilist.
But it’s not Robinson’s fists you should fear. His vocal chords, rather, are unsettling, protean howls defiant of genre, convention, or common sense. The same goes for Oxbow, who’ve spent the past quarter-century or so churning out some of the most eccentric (and criminally underrated) heavy music albums ever made. Now, the Bay Area group are back for another genre-bending fight with their first album in over a decade, Thin Black Duke.
Chaos may be Oxbow’s calling card, but on Thin Black Duke, the insanity is a facade. In a press release, composer and producer Niko Wenner (who co-founded the project alongside Robinson in 1989, as a duo) framed the album as an exercise in “large scale coherence.” It undertakes the classical practice of populating mammoth soundscapes with leitmotifs (a melodic phrase, a lyric, a subject) that function like aural trail markers. Sometimes the details manifest as a chorus, like in the wailed refrain on “Letter of Note.” Other times, it’s with repeated references to the titular character himself—whose story proves nearly impossible to parse out when issued forth from Robinson’s venomous gut.
Robinson wields his voice as a vehicle for disorder, and by extension, transcendence. He doesn’t sing with the music, but against it. On the album’s most immediate song, the turbulent piano-rocker “A Gentleman’s Gentleman,” he traces the performative trajectory of a paradoxical couplet (“And when the Duke talks, he sounds like a mime/With his hands doing all the talking”). The phrase initially clambers out of the bluesy miasma as a rabid, incomprehensible whisper (“Andwhentheduketalkshesoundslikeamime”); it then gets thrown on the rack for some syllable-stretching (“His haaaaaaaands doing all the talking”) before emerging from the torture refreshed.
Lightyears away from the unpredictable, exhausting pacing of their early work, Thin Black Duke reflects a formalism that places it closer to Faith No More than Scratch Acid. Where past albums find Oxbow trapped in the eye of the storm with nowhere to run, Thin Black Duke’s tracklist contains a clear arc: a gnarled beginning, all clattering riffs and piercing screams, a dreamlike middle swath. And the six-and-a-half-minute closer “The Finished Line” is a satisfying climax, uniting the album’s scattered stylistic flirtations under the banner of carnal dramaturgy. With Thin Black Duke, Oxbow once again envision a world domineered by disorder, a carnivalesque arena where music’s most intimidating, grandiose genres (free jazz, high-concept chamber pop, noise, neoclassical, metal) can duke it out like gladiators one minute, and come together for a grotesque group hug the next. It may not be their definitive show of force, but it’s a dazzling spectacle nonetheless.",2017-05-11T05:00:00,['Metal'],7.3,Hydra Head,Oxbow: Thin Black Duke Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23192-thin-black-duke/,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2017-05-11,5.6068493150684935,2017.25,0.0
28,Like Rats,['Mark Kozelek'],"1 / 2 Albums
Live at Phoenix Public House Melbourne draws heavily from Sun Kil Moon's Among the Leaves, and underpins the conflict in Kozelek's gratitude toward his fans-- whose support has led him into a lonely life of touring. In that respect, Like Rats, a new set of covers, may be considered a peace offering.
""So I spent all yesterday hanging out by myself,"" says Mark Kozelek between songs on his new live album. ""Went out last night... by myself. Spent today... by myself. It's alright. I spend a lot of time by myself."" This might be one of the more revealing moments on any Kozelek/Sun Kil Moon/Red House Painters release: a complete and pointed dismissal of any romanticism that might still cling to the touring life. Rather than carouse around Melbourne or even see the sights, he admits, ""I don't even know the name of the hotel I'm at. I just walked around the park, went to the 7-11, ate some nuts or something. I don't fucking know. I was bored out of my fucking mind.""
That disappointment-- the unbridgeable rift between how you dream your life will go and how it actually turns out-- is the subject of Kozelek's most recent studio album, last year's harrowing, weirdly humorous Among the Leaves. Song after song bemoans the fate of a cult musician in his 40s, a songwriter's songwriter who has put 20 years into a career that has leveled out, who has won glowing reviews but has very little to show for it except his name on a marquee. 7-11s in Melbourne look just like 7-11s everywhere else; a bag of nuts can be the highlight of your day. Expressing his extreme weariness with the touring life, Kozelek sounds better than he has in years-- more engaged, more personable, more observant, and more willing to describe the world around him, even if it tends to end at the stage lights.
Live at Phoenix Public House Melbourne may be his most substantial live album in ages. It draws heavily from Among the Leaves, and makes a worthy addendum to the studio recording because it places these songs in what sounds like their natural setting: a small club sparsely filled with adoring fans clapping politely even after Kozelek laments the lop-sided male: female ratio. There's a sobering gravity here, a weird black humor accentuated by the relatively short run time: 12 tracks instead of Among the Leaves' 17, coming in at a reasonable 60 minutes instead of 80.
Kozelek's guitar playing is precise and lovely, especially during the solo on ""Heron Blue"", and his voice retains its hangdog eloquence, effortlessly evoking his workaday loneliness on ""Broken Wing"" and the brutally candid ""Track Number 8"". Perhaps the standout on Phoenix, however, is the stage banter. Several of his previous live albums, including last year's On Tour, have excised his between-song ramblings, but they sound crucial to this set, a revealing counterpart to the songs. He exercises a sly humor that's at once gracious (commiserating with the staff who will lose their jobs when the Phoenix Public House closes) and biting (dedicating ""The Moderately Talented Young Woman"" to an audience member who describes herself as a musician and waitress).
There's a great, weird, tense moment when Kozelek considers the irony of a fan who loves his music so much that he downloads it illegally. ""I'm trying to understand. So you live in Melbourne, Australia, and you bought my music off a Russian web site. Why? Why'd you do that?"" Kozelek sounds both touched and offended. That's the central conflict on Among the Leaves, but it's even more pronounced on Live at Phoenix Public House: Kozelek is grateful for his fans' dedication over the years, but on some level he resents them for leading him into such a lonely life.
So maybe Like Rats is a peace offering. His previous covers albums have been fan favorites, presenting his melancholy takes on songs by AC/DC, John Denver, Low, and Stephen Sondheim, but this new collection may be his most varied and adventurous. The tracklist portrays a man with broad listening habits, who not only translates these songs into his own particular style but erases the distinctions between genres. ""Time is Love"", a silly concept song by Josh Turner, has the same rhythmic thrust as Ted Nugent's ""Free-for-All"", and the Descendents' ""Silly Girl"" proves just as melodic as the snappy ""Right Back Where We Started From"", the 1976 hit by UK singer Maxine Nightingale.
Just as he brings these songs into his realm, they expand his realm, forcing him to rethink how he uses his voice and guitar. He opens Genesis' ""Carpet Crawlers"" in lush a cappella, layering his vocals in a way that expresses a profound, possibly narcotized wonder at the little creatures around him, and the one-two punch of Bad Brains' ""I"" and Godflesh's ""Like Rats"" redirects his signature low-key sound to express something like outrage and anger-- a wholly new mode for Kozelek. On the other hand, Bruno Mars' ""Young Girls"" wryly comments on all the tales of obsessive female fans on Among the Leaves, and Kozelek turns the hook into a wistfully descending melody.
Any record that emphasizes variety will have a few tracks that fall just outside the artist's reach; not everything works quite so well, although that has more to do with song choice than execution. Despite his attempts to alter the melody, Kozelek's version of Danzig's ""13"" recalls Johnny Cash's similarly acoustic yet superior version, and he awkwardly truncates the Dayglo Abortions' ""I Killed Mommy"", as if he can't bring himself to sing some of the more extreme lyrics. While it does sound like the ultraviolent companion to Kozelek's understated serial killer rumination ""Glenn Tipton"" (which he revives on Live at Phoenix Public House), it ultimately sounds pointless and self-indulgent, intended perhaps to entertain himself more than his audience. But after so many bland hotels and anonymous convenience stores, who can blame him for making his own fun?",2013-02-19T06:00:01,['Rock'],6.7,Caldo Verde,Mark Kozelek: Live at Phoenix Public House Melbourne/Like Rats Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17626-mark-kozelek-live-at-phoenix-public-house-melbournelike-rats/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2013-02-19,1.3821917808219177,2013.0,0.0
29,Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP,['The Black Keys'],"Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney say goodbye to their longtime home, blues staple Fat Possum, with a salute to deceased former labelmate Junior Kimbrough.
The Black Keys are now well beyond obvious blues-rock duo comparisons, having carved out three of the best head-in-the-past, riffs-in-the-future albums of the past decade. Before ditching the only home they'd known, blues staple Fat Possum, for the NPRarified air of Nonesuch, Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney threw together this fitting farewell, saluting deceased labelmate Junior Kimbrough. In the process, they avoid the hammy recreations that cover albums often bring: This is no Encomium or Radiodread, but rather an acknowledgement of a hero and a simple cap-tip.
Working from the same modal electric blues that Kimbrough plied for decades, Black Keys take these songs and apply the swinging rollick and bended notes for which they've become known. Each track is a yearning, often flagellating ballad of sorts (titles: ""Have Mercy On Me"", ""Work Me"", ""My Mind Is Ramblin'"", etc.), and that's what Auerbach seems to have in common with Kimbrough-- a desperate wail coupled with subtly sophisticated guitar playing. But the songs sound completely different from the originals, sometimes distorting lyrical structure but mostly throwing a hazy, almost psychedelic trip onto what were once melodically downtuned blues arrangements.
The Keys have covered Kimbrough twice before and each of those other approaches was more straightforward and amped. ""Do the Rump"", from their debut The Big Come Up, is pretty ferocious rawk stuff. The aching ""Meet Me in the City""-- perhaps Kimbrough's best ever-- is a nice contrast to some of the liberties they take elsewhere. For a guy who sired 36 kids and died with a common-law wife, Kimbrough seems pretty screwed romantically, yowling ""Please don't leave me right now, girl, right now, oh no..."" Like his inspiration, Auerbach sings in an unclear mumble that adds a lived-in weight to the music. The white-boy imitators from Ohio jacking a Mississippi Delta shaman's style is an idea fraught with unmanageable questions. The Black Keys, however, have been graceful and more than honoring in the past about their muses, so there doesn't seem to be a lot of culture-transmogrification, other than the occasional ripped-off riff. That much is testified to by Kimbrough's widow, Mildred, on the last track via answering machine, where she notes that Auerbach and Carney are ""the only ones that really really played like Junior played his records."" The track is a bit of a shameless pat-on-the-back to round out a classy six-song affair, but I doubt Kimbrough would have a hard time jamming with these two.",2006-06-19T06:00:03,['Rock'],7.0,Fat Possum,The Black Keys: Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9005-chulahoma-the-songs-of-junior-kimbrough-ep/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2006-06-19,-5.294520547945205,2006.25,0.0
30,Printer’s Devil,['Ratboys'],"The Chicago band moves past its early twang into raucous alt-pop on an album that captures childhood confusions and adult yearning. 
On their earliest releases Ratboys tagged their sound “post-country,” but you really had to squint to hear the country. The twang on their 2017 album GN was more implied than explicit, and the music cozily straddled the line between woozy guitar pop and homespun folk. The whole album seemed to exist in a blissful state of in-between.
GN was a gem, the kind of album that’s hard to replicate, and on their follow-up Printer’s Devil, Ratboys don’t even really try. Years of sharing stages with punkier bands like PUP and Dowsing has thickened and toughened their sound, as has the solidification of a full-time rhythm section after years of touring with rotating drummers. Printer’s Devil is Ratboys’ first album as a four-piece, and there’s no mistaking the difference.
That riff-forward makeover brings them closer to the alt-pop of bands like Charly Bliss and Speedy Ortiz. On the surface that’s a step toward anonymity—not a lot of bands shared GN’s tender, ephemeral reimagining of Americana, while plenty share Printer’s Devil’s debt to the Veruca Salt lane of ’90s alternative. But it rips convincingly: The classic rock-spiked “Look To” is pure speaker candy, the kind of unabashed windows-down moment that GN’s muted production didn’t allow, while the guitars on “Anj” sizzle like early Paramore.
Even when working with less-novel sounds, singer Julia Steiner has individuality to spare, both as a vocalist and a songwriter. She’s not a howler. Instead she works her frayed voice like a pair of kitchen shears, doing her damage not through broad swipes but well-placed snips. Her warmth and whimsy seeps through even Printer’s Devil’s grungiest songs. Like Doug Martsch, Jenny Lewis, and David Byrne before her, she captures how childhood confusions linger into adulthood. And like those songwriters, her cleverness never masks her vulnerability. On “I Go Out at Night,” one of the record’s rare softer numbers, she pictures herself in “a job uninstalling ’90s payphones,” a wry image but also a wistful metaphor for growing up.
Ratboys demoed the album in Steiner’s empty childhood home just after it had been sold, which she’s said was as emotionally taxing as you’d expect. That experience may account for the extra ache in these songs. Steiner fills Printer’s Devil with half-remembered snapshots of adolescence—sprints down hills in the summertime, a ride on an airplane simulator at the mall—juxtaposed with images of overgrown grass, vacated lots and other innocuous signifiers of the passage of time that carry weight only in the rare moments we pause to consider them. The effect is comforting and sobering all at once, like revisiting your elementary school’s playground as an adult. The swings are still there; you can sit on them, even. But whatever you’re hoping to reclaim is long gone.

31,Absence,['Dälek'],"Dälek follow 2002's From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots with another collection of dense, well-sculpted hip-hop. On Absence, the rhymes are more direct than on its predecessor but they're still complex and considered.
I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to describe Dälek's third album without making it sound repetitive and boring, two things it most certainly isn't. Whereas many modern hip-hop albums spill over with infectious beats and sci-fi sounds, and draw variety from a wide array of hired-in producers and guest spots, this does the opposite: It's the product of just three guys-- Dälek, Oktopus, and Still-- and the entire record is built around essentially a couple of simple beats with slight yet important variations.
Dälek have a knack for taking basic elements and sculpting them differently every time, a controlled, deliberate attack designed for pinpoint destruction and insight. They can turn a sheet of blistering, white-hot skree into a convincing hook simply by attaching it to the right part of the beat and controlling the volume and density of the noise, allowing Dälek's complex, considered rhymes to weave their way through the tangle. Here, the harsh, cavernous textures coating the songs are ostensibly all dissonant, droning walls of noise cut through with scratches and samples.
The templates of Dälek's tracks are augmented by an incredible wealth of detail in both their beats and backdrops. Cascading flumes of gutter noise torment the edges of ""Asylum (Permanent Underclass)"": They heave and bend, wavering in pitch and contorting into snatches of tortured melody. Close listening reveals that the squall is actually a tight cluster of dozens of drones, added and subtracted to mold the music into grit-teethed crescendos and dizzying passages of spiraling, exquisitely controlled chaos.
Dälek the MC spits head-spinning verses like ""Who trades his culture for dollars/ The fool or the scholar/ Griot, poet, or white collar"" (""Culture for Dollars"") and ""Seen your movements through peripheral/ Remain same individual/ When a man's viewed as criminal to act animal is logical"" (""Distorted Prose""). There's nary a nod to sex or personal enrichment, and in fact he opens the album by rapping, a cappela, ""Broke stride as last of men realized their deep deceit/ This troubling advance of half-assed crews crowd these streets,"" a broad and open indictment of what he seems to see as hip-hop straying from its early ideals.
In ""Eyes to Form Shadows"", he speeds up his flow as melody is forcibly wrenched from queasy, metallic tones, before culminating with ""Addicts move in slow increments within granite/ Hands bound and damaged are weapons we brandish/ Deemed savage by masses/ When this anger's just average."" Dälek's unsatisfied with nearly everything-- and politics are no exception. On ""Asylum"", he skewer administration arrogance and fear-mongering with clear-eyed and direct lyrics that avoid the tendency toward opaque abstraction that bogs down so much underground hip-hop.
Crunching along in an endlessly innovative fashion, Absence seems old-school in its simplicity, clarity and forthrightness, but sounds futuristic. And although the album is full of abstract noise and painstaking sound sculpture, the no-nonsense approach to beat-making and Dälek's modest flow make this album more accessible than its presecessor, 2002's From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots. That album had higher peaks than this one, but Absence is more consistently engaging-- and another powerful statement from one of modern hip-hop's greatest crews.",2005-02-16T06:00:01,['Rap'],8.3,Ipecac,Dälek: Absence Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2149-absence/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2005-02-16,-6.631506849315069,2005.0,0.0
32,Grey Oceans,['CocoRosie'],"Hugely successful cult act continues to travel their own love/hate path, now for Sub Pop after years with Touch and Go.
What would CocoRosie have to do at this point for you to change your mind about them? One of the world's biggest cult acts remains one of its most divisive. Whether it's their absurd cover art, affected vocals, one-time affiliations with too-ironic parties, or their many famous friends, something about CocoRosie causes grudges to be held. To be honest, I wish I could let that baggage get me worked up about Grey Oceans-- music is most fun when it inspires strong feelings. Instead, CocoRosie's least abrasive record to date merely disappoints softly.
From the moment you enter Grey Oceans, CocoRosie make clear that you're on their time and in their universe. But while song titles like ""R.I.P. Burn Face"" and ""Fairy Paradise"" suggest they still have a sense of humor about what they're bringing to the party, the Casady sisters seem more grounded here. This record sands off some of their pricklier affectations-- the half-raps and genre exercises are gone, and so is most of their provocative lyricism.
Some highlights: Opener ""Trinity's Crying"" patiently works through warped synth and harp to create a sort of Matrix-y new age tenor. There's a nice contrast between the vaudeville hook of ""Hopscotch"" and its jungle-esque rhythm, and once ""Lemonade"" stops dragging ass, it builds to a satisfying horn section. But in spite of these sounds, too much of Grey Oceans is as murky and impenetrable as its title. Eventually, it becomes bogged down in the same kind of downtempo, piano-and-effects balladry as all those old Poe and Dot Allison CDs littering discount used bins.
But when you get down to brass tacks, it's the vocals (particularly Bianca's) that will probably end up being the dealbreaker as long as CocoRosie make records. It's not that her voice is too alien-- Björk channeling Billie Holiday is pretty much the ballpark-- but its unorthodoxy never feels like it's in the service of expressiveness. Instead, the affectations become both the means and the end, and whatever beauty could be wrangled from the plodding piano pieces or resonance you might get out of lyrics like, ""I'm afraid of sharks but not of the dark,"" are ruined by the fact that they sound like they're curdling in her mouth.
I understand why CocoRosie have engendered the admiration of their peers: Even with their success, they're still operating on the fringe, and while Grey Oceans is less caustic than their other work, it still has that lay-it-all-on-the-line quality that's worked for Antony Hegarty, Devendra Banhart, and Joanna Newsom. The difference is that the album never feels like anything's at stake, whereas past records embraced experimentation at any cost. If anything, the Casadys invert the purpose of folk music by coming at it from a place of indulgence rather than sharing. Then again, the majority of CocoRosie's praise stems from them ""being themselves,"" so it's no surprise that even at their most user-friendly, they don't sound like an act that has much use for an audience.",2010-05-12T06:00:00,"['Folk/Country', 'Pop/R&B']",5.1,Sub Pop,CocoRosie: Grey Oceans Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14217-grey-oceans/,reviews/albums,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2010-05-12,-1.395890410958904,2010.25,0.0
33,Crossing Over EP,['Sour Widows'],"The Bay Area trio takes several beats to slow down and expand on a nice EP that mines indie rock and slowcore for its finest components. 
When the pandemic hit, Sour Widows had just taken a big leap into the unknown. In February 2020, the Bay Area trio released their self-titled debut EP, a six-song set with alt-pop hooks and slowcore-infused grandeur. What particularly set them apart was the interplay between the two singer/guitarists, Maia Sinaiko and Susanna Thomson, who have a talent for subtle builds to a big climax. Bolstered by empathetic drumming by their longtime friend Max Edelman, it’s tantalizing to imagine what they could’ve done if they’d played SXSW last year as originally scheduled.
Their new Crossing Over EP, recorded remotely, could quite literally have never existed without the tragic disjuncture of a world on pause. But it’s also a bit of a mulligan, an extra chance to define themselves before a planned full-length debut. With Crossing Over, Sour Widows seize this unusual opportunity, leaning into their more introspective, atmospheric side across four songs that glide by in what feels like both less and more than their 22 minutes. They’re beguiling and impressive, showcasing a band with lightness as well as heft.
Again and again on Crossing Over, Sour Widows create a sense of false comfort out of rudimentary furnishings, only to pull the emotional rug out from underneath. The sprawling title track is inspired, Thomson has said, by the reality of a long-distance relationship, and there’s a gentle familiarity both to the song’s Bedhead-ed opening riffs and the first verse’s apparently autobiographical description of battling the elements on an earlier, do-it-yourself tour. Before long, though, the guitars have become brambled, the storm imagery tangled up with the remote romance. Thomson and Sinaiko are harmonizing about, first, “Something in me crossing over in me,” and then “this life/splitting in me over and over in me,” and then there’s a ragged, windswept guitar solo. When “Crossing Over” finally ends, with an extended outro, it’s in a state of exhilarating ambivalence.
Other songs on the EP use a similarly basic toolkit to achieve a similar giddy transcendence. Opening song “Look the Other Way” also relies on slow-burn guitars, splashing cymbals, and vine-like harmonies, passing through more lyrical inversions (“When you look the other way” becomes “I won’t look the other way”) en route to another piercing guitar solo. But the effect is almost as wonderfully disorienting, and there’s a charming loftiness to a line like, “Someday I’ll be as dead as a star.” The closing “Walk All Day” is Sour Widows at their most cozy and cosmic, with fingers squeaking over acoustic guitar frets as Sinaiko and Thomson murmur about cell division, angels, and how “love is blind/leading the blind.” Sour Widows find the infinite in the intimate.
The narrative stakes in these songs are higher than they may seem, too. “Bathroom Stall,” which Sinaiko has said is “about a relationship I had with someone who struggled with addiction, who very tragically passed away three years ago while we were together,” again travels from serenity to catharsis. But there’s a jarring physicality to its climactic scene. “Do you remember it like I do?/Your lips turned blue/I had my fingers in your mouth/And I couldn’t get them out,” the band sings. With the Crossing Over EP, Sour Widows have a chance to reintroduce themselves, and they’ve come back wielding raw vulnerability like a superpower.

34,Paradygm Shift,['Robert Hood'],"With his latest full-length, techno pioneer Robert Hood returns to his true-form minimal techno—a style the producer is often credited with inventing.
Nearly twenty-five years after emerging as a pioneering techno artist, making his name as a central figure in Underground Resistance, Robert Hood remains one of the most in demand DJs in the world. He lives a double life: one, as an ordained minister in rural Alabama; another, as a strobe-lit, globe-trotting selector. Those identities converge in his project Floorplan, in which he makes stomping gospel-house alongside his daughter. (Hood once said with Floorplan, “God literally told me, ‘I want you to put a gospel message in the music.’”) But Hood’s signature arpeggiated techno loops play out in his work under his own name. The Detroit-bred producer has fine-tuned his recipe for making bodies move, and his touring schedule remains rigorous; he plays to packed clubs and thousands-strong festival crowds almost every weekend. It’s befuddling that Hood manages any studio time in between.
Paradygm Shift is the second full-length record from Hood in as many years, following 2016’s Floorplan record Victorious. As Robert Hood, his tracks are monochrome and more skeletal than the flashy, big-room house of Floorplan. Paradygm Shift is a return for Hood to his true-form minimal techno—a style the producer is often credited with inventing on his landmark 1994 album Minimal Nation. Cuts from that record, like “Acrylic,” “Ride,” and “Unix,” are masterworks of efficiency and bear the gold standard of stripped-down dance music. Then and now, Hood’s subtle tweaks and variations make the sequenced synthesizers come alive; the ever-present, pounding kick drum is a militant metronome that Hood abuses gracefully as his melodies slide into morphing grooves between the beats. This is capital-T Techno that’s psychedelic straight to its mechanical core.
“I Am” has a bouncing, hypnotic funk that hearkens back to Minimal Nation most directly. Gently rising chords are filtered down to their deepest, lowest frequencies. As Hood builds the track, the chords grow menacing, distorting and slipping between beats. There’s an illusory effect to these mutations, as micro-shifts between the interlocking rhythms keep the track in perpetual motion—simultaneously rising and falling.
“Nephesh” offers a dubbier, rounder sound, with a gentle two-chord progression quietly anchoring the spiraling stabs as Hood filters his synths nimbly. “Thought Process” is sharp and punchy, as a kick drum awkwardly tries to slink into the groove in the track’s final turn. “Pattern 8” has a slippery feel, and the clanking bell melody is locked to a 12-step sequence that is constantly shifting between measures. It’s a technique that is quintessential to his style, but relying on a workhorse sequencing method, “Pattern 8” feels like Hood is riding on auto pilot.
Hood’s enduring genius has been his ability to take listeners from Point A to Point B in his tracks without realizing how he took you there. On Paradygm Shift, he forgoes the lean machine of Minimal Nation for a more immediate and voracious, full-body sound. Hood said of this record that he wanted to “reiterate Robert Hood as an electronic music artist who is bringing minimalism back in the forefront, and not to get lost in the melody.” For Hood’s fans, this ambition is certainly welcome—but wanting to reinvent the wheel on Paradygm Shift, he falters with uninspired execution. Still, Hood’s dedication to precisely-crafted techno and transcendent DJ sets proves he still has plenty of gas left in the tank.",2017-06-10T05:00:00,['Electronic'],6.9,Dekmantel,Robert Hood: Paradygm Shift Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23380-paradygm-shift/,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2017-06-10,5.689041095890411,2017.25,0.0
35,Winning Star Champion,['Ruler'],"Seattle indie scene veteran Matt Batey contrasts bouncy power-pop with lyrics about anxiety and failure on his cathartic solo debut for Barsuk.
Power-pop isn’t necessarily the ideal medium for defeatism, but Matt Batey makes the unexpected combination of style and mood work. On Winning Star Champion, his debut LP as Ruler, the Seattle-based singer-songwriter reckons with anxiety and failure, in lyrics that act as perfect cloud cover for the sunshine his bright, infectious melodies constantly radiate.
It's hard to make feeling bad sound so good, but Batey pulls it off with ease. A fixture of Seattle's indie rock scene over the last decade, he’s played in Rocky Votolato's band and been part of the synth-driven indie-pop outfit Cataldo. Around 2011, he began working on his Ruler material in earnest, paying his compositions sporadic attention while working day shifts at Alaska Airlines. “I'm very poor,” he told Billboard in a remarkably candid interview that accompanied the premiere of his single “Petrified,” explaining that, “Sometimes I had money to spend on stuff, so that's when I would take time in a studio, and when I didn't have money it just kind of stopped.""
In the same interview, Batey connected his struggles with anxiety to the experience of turning 30 and watching his friends settle down and start families while he kept making music and barely paying bills. When he left home, at age 18, he told himself, “‘I'm not gonna be one of those guys that just plays in this band forever.’” But now, “12 years later it's like, 'OK, maybe I will be that guy.’” That revelation fuels Winning Star’s “Cars and Houses,” a swinging highlight in which Batey's boyish voice contrasts his peers’ aspirational, suburbs-and-minivan lifestyle with his own days spent gigging through small towns and crashing on floors.
Some songwriters may hit 30 and decide they have it all figured out, but he's forthcoming about not having all the answers—or, really, any of them. “When I get a new book I always draw in straight lines/For at least a couple pages I can pretend that is what I'm like,” Batey sings on the jangly title track, in which he also admits to being ""the winning star champion of fucking up.” On “The Cure,” a simple bass-and-drum pairing buoys a dark pronouncement: “One day I'll relax/And it will be perfect/To feel my bones under the ground.” Fatalism often sounds self-pitying or pretentious, but Batey’s admissions don’t come off as performative. He’s simply expressing the salient truth that modern life can be exhausting.
Lest he come across as too much of a mope, though, Winning Star packs even its most morose tracks with bursts of exuberance. Like Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest, Batey uses rock music to transmute his anxiety into fist-pumping catharsis. Assisted by a bevy of Pacific Northwest studio geeks (including his co-producer and kindred spirit Michael Lerner, of Seattle power-pop mainstays Telekinesis), he finds joy in joylessness. “Petrified” thrashes with an energy akin to that of late-era Superchunk, while the winding “Unhindered Pace” is garnished with lovely vocal harmonies and a floaty keyboard solo. Smack dab in the middle of “Cars and Houses,” Batey lets loose with an exuberant “whoa-oh-oh” over guitars that sound massive, in a shameless act of rock indulgence that nonetheless feels appropriate to the song.
For much of the current decade, the kind of sugary, hook-laden rock music that predominates on Winning Star has been woefully unfashionable. Meanwhile, the album’s quieter moments (particularly ""Get to You,"" with its chugging drum machine) evoke early Death Cab for Cutie, who’ve maintained their cultural cachet even as their whispery, wordy songwriting style has largely ceased to influence younger bands. So it makes sense that Batey has found a home on Death Cab’s old label, Barsuk, which has persisted for years in supporting this specific variety of indie rock. An alternately raucous and pensive soundtrack to fucking up, getting by, and learning from all of it, Winning Star is proof that the Barsuk sound is still worth championing.",2018-06-05T05:00:00,['Rock'],7.1,Barsuk,Ruler: Winning Star Champion Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ruler-winning-star-champion/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2018-06-05,6.675342465753425,2018.25,0.0
36,Moonlit Navigation,['Inexorum'],"On their beautiful second LP, the Minneapolis duo conjure the grandeur of Scandinavian extreme metal with reverence. 
Time is a fickle mistress, and so are metal fans’ sympathies. Bands who end up stuck in era-specific transitional subgenres like melodic death metal, for example (or metalcore, or crossover thrash, or blackgaze) still have their fans and their place in history, but are often left behind as the genre forges ahead without them.
But, even though melodic death metal, its close associate, melodic black metal, and their hellish spawn, melodic blackened death metal, may not be all that cool anymore, it doesn’t mean that fans have stopped loving them. While their popularity and visibility have plummeted since the late ’90s and early ’00s, these subgenres are still going, with their own classics and new devotees. The Minneapolis duo Inexorum are a case in point: Their second LP, Moonlit Navigation, sounds like a guided tour through the best of the ‘90s Necropolis Records catalog. Helmed by Carl Skildum with the new addition of Matthew Kirkwold, the project’s unabashed worship of melodic Scandinavian extreme metal is a joy to hear, and they deliver it with reverence.
Describing Inexorum’s chosen micro-genre demands hair-splitting; to be brief, the sound marries the most melodic forms of black metal and death metal, adding occasional dashes of Viking-metal grandeur. Skildum has referenced his love for this particular era before, and Moonlit Navigation is dotted with sonic references to early Dawn, Sacramentum, and, fittingly, Amorphis, whose Tales From The Thousand Lakes may as well have been written about his own rural Minnesota upbringing. And in a testament to the living nature of the genre, those who came upon this scene a bit later may instead recognize shades of more recent acts like Amon Amarth, Thulcandra, or Insomnium. But Skildum and Kirkwold blend signifiers so seamlessly that their sound becomes its own living, breathing thing.
Both band members also play in death thrashers Antiverse and serve as part of medieval metal visionaries Obsequiae’s live lineup, so their genre agnosticism comes as no surprise. Picking apart songs like the grandiose title track or more downbeat “Chains of Loss” in order to deem this bit more death metal, or this bit more purely black, feels misguided; to properly appreciate an album like Moonlit Navigation, the listener must commit to occupying that messy space in between. The clear delineations that now separate death metal and black metal did not exist in their chosen sound’s heyday, and it’s a credit to Skildum that he allows everything to bleed together.
The cold, windswept atmosphere that hangs over the record is as important as the riffs or Skildrum’s weathered growl; there is a sense of place, grounded in the northern woods and jeweled lakes that surround the duo. The bombastic “Dream and Memory” allows the folk-influenced melodies and soaring grandiosity of Viking metal—its own complex beast—to imprint itself on Inexorum’s sound. On the triumphal, synth-powered “The Breaking Point,” which features guest vocalist Sarah Roddy, Inexorum wreathes its stirring melodies in uptempo thrash beats and blasts of frigidity. The acoustic interlude “Wild Magic” offers a momentary respite before “In Desperate Times” closes the coffin lid with a flourish of blastbeats and razor-sharp black metal riffing.
One of the beauties of Moonlit Navigation—for it is an overwhelmingly beautiful album—is Skildum’s ability to craft something new from older, near-forgotten pieces. When there are so many boundary pushing new bands drawing extreme metal forward—from black metal anarchists Dawn Ray’d and extreme metal shapeshifters Immortal Bird to Inexorum’s genre-smashing labelmates Thou and noise-rock vanguardists Couch Slut—it can be hard to understand why anyone would feel compelled to look backwards. But with their latest, Inexorum has provided a compelling argument for honoring the best of extreme metal’s past, even as we continue to carve out its faster, louder, weirder future.

37,Ullakkopalo,['Kemialliset Ystävät'],"Finland's Fonal, a leading label in the psych and freak folk worlds, releases another dense tapestry of electro-acoustic sound from Jan Anderzén.
When I first heard about Finland's Kemialliset Ystävät-- the project of artist Jan Anderzén, who sometimes records with others and sometimes records solo-- the music was described as ""folk."" Since I didn't have a good idea of what Finnish folk would sound like and knew nothing about the Fonal label, I came to Kemialliset Ystävät expecting to hear acoustic guitars and maybe some vocal harmonies with perhaps the addition of a few stringed instruments native to the region. What I got instead was a dense tapestry of electro-acoustic sound, any individual aspect of which was difficult to source. There were samples and whirring electronics and weirdly tuned guitars and synthesizers and clomping percussion and processed vocals, all kind of swirled together into this woozy, colorful, undifferentiated jumble. But as impenetrable as the music was, it wasn't completely abstract, and there were melodies and careful arrangements popping out of the din that became more apparent the more closely I listened. After a while, the word ""folk"" began to seem just right: This had the feel of a music handed down through generations and re-created with the materials on hand. It's just that the materials on hand included things with circuit boards that you plugged into the wall.
Ullakkopalo is the first Kemialliset Ystävät full-length in three years, and the project essentially picks up where 2007's self-titled album left off. Which is to say that if someone casually interested in this band put the two albums on shuffle (maybe with some earlier Kemialliset Ystävät records thrown in), it would be tough to tell which track belonged to which release. Once again, there are voices, bleeps, acoustic strums, electric guitar leads, bits of chanting, some proper singing-- all put together just so, but arranged a way that stops well short of what most would define as a ""song."" But while the surface-level similarity of Kemialliset Ystävät albums is a consideration for someone with a number of releases by the project who might want to spend money on one more (and the gorgeous packaging of Fonal releases is a good argument for owning a physical copy), it doesn't diminish the force of the music as a whole. The essential character of Kemialliset Ystävät is that it feels like it grew out of something-- that there were certain rules in place and parameters for how the music would be constructed, and what emerged was an album with its own bent logic. In this particular environment, it feels natural for differences to be subtle.
Which is not to say that individual moments don't make themselves known upon repeated listens, to the point where you look forward to them. There are the haunted voices in ""Kivikasan Rauhassa"", which sound like a twisted version of a working song sung by cartoon dwarves marching into the mines. There's the toy keyboard melody of the swaying ""Ystävälliset Miekat"", which has the essence of both an early-1990s video game and a ceremonial middle ages dirge. There's the wonderfully compact guitar lead that opens ""Älä Koske Lintuja"", which sounds familiarly late-60s psych and alien simultaneously, a disorienting combo heightened by the sproingy percussion that follows.
Ultimately this music seems deeply organic, using a specific dictionary definition of the word: ""having an organization similar in its complexity to that of living things."" And because it sounds so connected to nature, it can be initially hard to absorb in its specifics. You could be standing in a field somewhere looking around and everything looks the same-- it's a field, like any other field. Or you could get down on your hands and knees and dig into the grass and notice the tiny things living there and how this blade is dead and that blade is half-eaten by something and so on. That's how Kemialliset Ystävät feels-- like something ready to be explored on whatever level feels right.",2010-08-26T06:00:04,"['Experimental', 'Rock']",7.6,Fonal,Kemialliset Ystävät: Ullakkopalo Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14593-ullakkopalo/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2010-08-26,-1.1054794520547946,2010.5,0.0
38,There Existed an Addiction to Blood,['clipping.'],"Despite being based on a ’70s vampire film, the rap trio’s album is somehow their most bloodless project to date.
Rap trio clipping. take pride in their commitment to ego death. When they formed they adopted two foundational rules—strict avoidance of first-person perspectives and the word nigga—just to make explicit that their music is not about them. Using found sounds, foley tricks, and imagined characters, rapper Daveed Diggs and producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes fabricated entire worlds. Following the space opera of 2016’s Splendor & Misery, which was actually nominated for a Hugo Award following a fan campaign, and the abstract improvisation of 2018’s Face EP, they channel horrorcore.
Their third album is named after a lyric from the soundtrack of ’70s horror film Ganja & Hess, a surreal love story in which a vampiric black couple wrestles with their appetite for blood. The movie is lurid, mysterious, and tender, a combination that completely eludes clipping. Somehow, despite the gory source material, There Existed an Addiction to Blood is their most bloodless project to date.
Their vision of horror is high-octane, high-concept, and fussy. Technically, there is a lot happening in their meticulous, densely referential songs. Across There Existed an Addiction to Blood there are shootouts, a ScHoolboy Q interpolation (Diggs uses Q’s flow from “What They Want” on “Nothing is Safe”)and a resurrected Bobby Hutton on “Blood of the Fang”—but every detail feels exhaustingly mechanical.
As a vocalist, Diggs has the charisma of a metronome and the expressive range of a sock puppet. Performing in a stiff monotone, he exclusively raps fast or faster, enunciating words with crisp diction but never relishing them or giving them life. “And there may even be some meaning gleaming in the streets that they built/On top of dead bodies in the olden days when the pen was a quill,” he raps on “Intro.” “The best menage is a death menage, agree?/ Chest massage with electric rods for three,” he says on “The Show.” You can appreciate the internal rhymes and inversions, but his flow is so robotic it rarely feels like he appreciates them
Snipes and Hutson are just as perfunctory. Their production style is informed by film scores and a range of genres, but their beats are dry and lifeless. “He Dead” is a dirge that dissolves into bland ambience. “Club Down,” presumably an ode to shut-the-party-down Memphis crunk, is built around an arid, prickly drone that wanes in and out of focus. Drumless and peppered with EFX, the beat is as vast and empty as an airlocked bunker. The sole outlier is “Blood of the Fang,” which works elements from Ganja & Hess into a throbbing romp that Diggs navigates nimbly. It's one of the rare moments where his flows feel loose and natural.
In theory, the pulp and theater of horrorcore should fit clipping.'s skill set. Snipes has done extensive work as a composer for TV and film; Hutson has a background in experimental music, and Diggs is an actor and slam poet. Attention to atmosphere and cadence is essential to all their disciplines, and horrorcore has often drawn from the TV and movie horror canon. What sinks the record is its enduring sense of cosplay. Horrorcore is about terror as a mood and as a state of mind. When RZA mocks suicide, Tyler defiles corpses, or Lord Infamous summons demons, there’s a sense of alienation behind the provocation. The point of horrorcore is to both piss off church moms and find a language and vehicle for rage and misery. But there is no aching, tortured self at the center of clipping., just three fanboys’ overworked hearts palpitating into the abyss. While you can’t deny the imagination, you also can’t fathom the point.

39,Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper,['Panda Bear'],"Best new music
More streamlined than 2007's Person Pitch, yet more rhythmically robust than 2011's Tomboy, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper is Panda Bear’s toughest, grimiest, and funkiest album to date.
The great irony about bringing a new life into this world is you start worrying a lot more about death. Not just that of the family members you must provide for and protect, but your own, as well. Plain and simple, the first rule of parenting is: don’t die. When entrusted with the immense obligation of caring for a child, even the youngest of new parents become exceedingly conscious of their own mortality and survival instincts. Behaviors once taken for granted—like, say, air travel or cycling alongside cars on city streets—start to feel more like roulette games wagered with your life; once-considered activities like bungee jumping and skydiving get transferred from your bucket list to a ""fuck that"" list.
You could hear that sort of uneasiness gradually seep into the seemingly serene work of Noah Lennox—a.k.a. Panda Bear—over the past decade, both without and within Animal Collective. As the first A.C. member to become a parent, Lennox has become increasingly fond of rooting his boundless sonic exploration in meditations on home life, whether cheekily celebrating the drudgery of domesticity (""Chores""), eulogizing the family dog (""Derek""), making heartfelt affirmations of paternal duty (""My Girls""), or openly fretting over his shortcomings as a breadwinner (“Alsatian Darn”). And though he’s avoided explicitly ecclesiastical language in his solo work since writing 2004’s psych-folk hymnal Young Prayer for his late father, each Panda Bear record released since has retained the form and feel of a communal church service: They welcome us in with reassuring proverbs (""try to remember always, always to have a good time"") couched in heaven-sent harmonies, provide a sense comfort in the face of encroaching chaos, and strive to connect our physical world to a more celestial plane. And be it the psychedelic pop sprawl of 2007’s Person Pitch or the dub-like lurch of 2011’s Tomboy, a Panda Bear record ultimately requires a test of faith, a belief that Lennox’s beaming voice will guide us safely through the dense, phantasmagoric fog that threatens to consume it. In Lennox’s cathedral of sound, you can always see the stormy skies creeping in view through the radiant stained-glass windows.
On his latest venture, the tension between inner peace and external pressure reaches boss-battle proportions. Lifting its main-event billing from old King Tubby records, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper serves a similar function for its creator as Slasher Flicks did for Avey Tare—it’s a playful, fantastical response to some serious life changes. In Portner’s case, it was divorce and strep throat; for Lennox, it’s the entry into middle age and the substantial familial responsibilities that go with it. In a recent Rolling Stone interview, Lennox pondered the possibility of retiring the Panda Bear moniker, which makes sense—part of getting older is doing away with your old college nicknames. But if that is indeed the case, Panda Bear is not going down without a fight.
More streamlined than Person Pitch and more rhythmically robust than Tomboy, Grim Reaper is Panda Bear’s toughest, grimiest, and funkiest album to date. But all that extra grit and groove doesn’t come at the expense Lennox’s unmistakable melodic graces, which still provide each song with its pulse. As to be expected from an album co-produced with Tomboy holdover Pete Kember (a.k.a. Sonic Boom of '80s psych-punk patriarchs the Spacemen 3) and reportedly inspired by classic '90s boom-bap beat construction, Grim Reaper achieves just the right balance of skull-splitting drone and head-noddin’ drive. In contrast to the unpredictably amorphous song structures that defined previous Panda Bear records, many of the songs on Grim Reaper lock into a looped beat and rarely waver course. However, they’re often prefaced by or dissolve into ominous, buzzing oscillations (some of which, like the half-minute ""Davy Jones' Locker"", are portioned off into stand-alone tracks) that suggest the onset of a panic attack or some shadowy predator. As such, the midnight-marauding march of lead single ""Mr Noah"" and electro-fuzzed yodeling of ""Boys Latin"" are transformed into weapons of retaliation—a strobe-lit assault on the encroaching bleakness. ""Dark cloud has descended again,"" Lennox sings on the chorus of the latter song, but his elated vocal thrusts the black mass back up into the stratosphere.
Lennox told Pitchfork last fall that, despite all the personal rumination that inspired Grim Reaper, he wanted to keep his lyrics purposefully non-specific and relatable. But for all its booming breaks and future-shocked freneticism, Grim Reaper—like all Panda Bear records—remains a highly insular experience, one where it often sounds as if Lennox is speaking into a mirror. ""So good, you’ve got it so good,"" he sings overtop the blissed-out shuffle of ""Crosswords""—a simple statement of fact from a happily married father of two who lives in a cosmopolitan coastal European city in between sold-out tours. But his wistful delivery betrays the fear of losing it all. And Lennox spends much of the seven-minute ""Come to Your Senses"" repeating a question (""Are you mad?"") for which there is only one logical answer (""Yeah, I’m mad""), as the song’s shantytown acid-house throb mediates between serenity and insanity. A sobering aftershock arrives in the form of late-album wake-up call ""Selfish Gene""—a sort-of post-rave ""That's Not Me""—where the incessant synth-jabs provide Lennox with needling reminders of his family-man mission (""When it comes to fill those spaces/ Only you can fill those spaces"").
Taken as a whole, Grim Reaper feels like a gradual process of Lennox trying to tune out the extraneous noise of modern life and focus on what’s truly important to him. And it’s an evolution mirrored by the album’s sequence, which bookends the most boisterous, beat-driven songs around two stunning centerpiece tracks—""Tropic of Cancer"" and ""Lonely Wanderer""—that provide Grim Reaper with an extended and well-earned moment of quiet contemplation. The former is a cosmic doo-wop serenade that stands as the most affecting and beautiful vocal performance of Lennox’s career; the latter projects a gorgeous, aqueous tranquility unheard from the Animal Collective camp since side two of Feels, its light piano drizzle summoning thundercloud rumbles of foreboding reverberations.
But even when it trades in day-glo stompers for weightless ballads, Grim Reaper still crushes. In the unsentimental, funereal refrain of ""Tropic of Cancer""—""you can’t get back, you won’t come back, you can’t come back to it""—Lennox invokes his father’s 2002 death and, in doing so, reemphasizes his own current reality as a patriarch, and that pervasive, deep-seated fear of prematurely leaving one’s family behind. If Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper posits adult life as some imaginary horror movie, it’s one where the phone call warning of impending doom is coming from inside the house.",2015-01-12T06:00:00,['Electronic'],8.7,Domino,Panda Bear: Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20079-panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper/,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2015-01-12,3.278082191780822,2015.0,0.0
40,"Designer Music: The Remixes, Vol. 1",['Carl Craig'],"Some people are born to ride free. Some people, on the other hand, will parade\n\ through life to the ...
Some people are born to ride free. Some people, on the other hand, will parade through life to the applause and acclaim of all around them. Carl Craig is one of those people. Since he stepped out onto center stage of Detroit techno, whatever he's released has been graced with universal acclaim. And while it's true that much of what he's produced is noteworthy, he's far from being able to turn muck into brass.
I've found that it's Craig's work under aliases that merits the real props. His 69 and Paperclip People guises give him the freedom to funk and get the floor buckling; as Innerzone Orchestra, Craig seriously indulges in his Sun Ra fantasies and I can't help but be sucked in. But the two albums released under his birthname seem awkward, stilted, and striving for ""art"" status.
Designer Music: The Remixes is an awkward compilation of Carl Craig's remixes of other musicians' material and as such showcases both his strengths and his indulgent arty weaknesses. On this disc, Craig veers from excellence to insouciance, and expects not to be called on it.
United Future Organization's ""Planet Plan"" is first up, setting the tone for the first half of the collection. The remix sounds as though the extent of the additional production was appending his own name to the track credits. As for his reworking of conguero Johnny Blas' ""Picadillo,"" Craig has stripped the Havana party horn blasts and let the congas rumble on for eight minutes. To be fair, ""Picadillo"" works as a DJ tool, and in doing so, harkens back to the original Designer Music 12"" Craig released for the long since defunct Planet E subscription series. ""Picadillo"" could easily serve as a transition disc from one Nuyorican effort to the next, but I question the need for it to be compiled.
However, Craig's Planet E Special mix of Incognito's ""Out of the Storm"" more than deserves inclusion on every techno compilation. Yes, every one. Craig takes Incognito's smooth, radio-friendly vocal jazz and transforms the band's oh-so sophisticated schlock into unadulterated techno soul. This is the track you should play to those who claim that music made by machines (e.g. techno) is devoid of soul. Out of a slopping, slinky downtempo rhythm, Craig develops a whirling dervish of ARP lines capable of transporting even the most stolid heart.
Unfortunately, the high induced by ""Out of the Storm"" is robbed from us by the mix of Telex's ""Moscow Diskow."" But to his credit, Craig isn't working with great material to begin with here. Contrary to what the Belgian cultural attaché might have you believe, Telex never did anything to disabuse the rest of the world of the notion that Belgium is an artistic vacuum. ""Moscow Diskow"" is an excruciating, Ed Wood Jr.-esque attempt at aping the glories of Kraftwerk. Telex's abilities are so minuscule that Craig is left to extend the track by four minutes or so, plopping in some extra-spacy blurps and blops, and collect his large honorarium check.
By the time you've reached this point in the album, you're praising whoever designed the skip forward button. Why bother with Craig's mix of Inner City's ""Buena Vida,"" which is little more than an a cappella or the directionless Urban Affair mix of BT's ""Moment of Truth?""
Of course, Craig forces us into enduring such brackish gruel in order to reap our reward: the final three tracks. Here, he showcases the dancefloor, where he's inarguably most secure and expert. The remixes of Spacetime Continuum, Alexander Robotnik, and Ron Trent each exude the no-nonsense nous Craig demonstrates whenever he produces a Paperclip People track. Yes, these remixes are minimal-- there are no jazzy tropes, no Latin flourishes. But in their stead, you get the pure sound of mechanical funk that sets Detroit apart from the rest of the world.
Designer Music: The Remixes just about makes a case for remixing being more than a mere marketing ploy.

41,O.K.,['Eskimeaux'],"An encouraging, comforting voice permeates O.K., Gabrielle Smith's second album in her solo project Eskimeaux. O.K. invites us to view the world through Smith's eyes, and somehow it feels as if Smith is lending her ear to you rather than the other way around.
The most appropriate word to describe Gabrielle Smith's solo project Eskimeaux might be ""togetherness."" The band founded Brooklyn songwriting and art collective the Epoch in 2011 along with several of their friends, but this sense of mutual support and do-it-together philosophy has long been a part of Smith's M.O. She originally formed Eskimeaux in 2007, all the while happily joining her peers' and fellow collective members' bands—Bellows, Told Slant, and Frankie Cosmos. Smith's songs reflect this type of profound concern for the well-being of those around her, an eagerness to take a backseat when others need her and a longing to still express her own sharp meditations on love and loneliness.
Several of the songs on O.K. are new versions of previous recordings, but this time around Smith has scaled back to outline each melody in clearer brush strokes. Where certain tracks on 2013's Igluenza were monotone or drawn out, they graduate to fully formed pop on this release. Before, ""I Admit I'm Scared"" felt flat despite its visually compelling lyrics (""Everything I said spewed like sparklers from my mouth/ They looked pretty as they flew but now they're useless and burnt out""), while here it's one of the album's strongest moments. Subtle harmonies slowly coax Smith's gentle alto into a confident soar over Felix Walworth's galloping drum fill. She casually divulges secrets as though her arm is already on your shoulder, her quiet relatability spiking upwards at the climax (""If I had a dime for every time I'm freaking out/ We could fly around the world or just get out of your parents' house"").
This encouraging, comforting voice permeates O.K. It may not always come in the form of a soft whisper in the night, but somehow it feels as if Smith is lending her ear to you rather than the other way around. Whether she's letting you know that it's okay to be scared and sad—notably on danceable bedroom pop number ""Alone at the Party""—or tenderly confessing how important you are (""The Thunder Answered Back""), the sweetness isn't saccharine, it's sincere and intimate. And when the entire band accompanies Smith on the latter track, she serves gut-wrenching doses of candor: ""It must feel like fucking hell/ To be a patchwork of yourself."" Smith is a hyper-aware observer, able to pinpoint others' despair just as well as her own.
Sonically, O.K. is the most fitting pallette for Smith's work. In the past she's played around with drum machines and broken synth beats, which weighed her down in gloomy, droning noise. This LP finally matches Eskimeaux's illuminating presence. She slips from sparse indie-folk to ethereal pop throughout the record, each arrangement rich and meticulously composed. The band never overpowers Smith's celestial vocals, and she's able to keep up with the slow-burning tension when it eventually detonates. Walworth's attentive drumming is a welcome addition that swells and retracts to complement Jack Greenleaf's twinkling synth arpeggios.
At face value, it's easy to mistake Smith's nursery rhyme name-dropping and misty-eyed warmth for childlike naiveté. However, she's no Pollyanna—she's simply acknowledging the darkness and aiming to move past it. O.K. invites us to view the world through Smith's eyes. The unassuming strength of her vision is what makes that invitation so worth accepting.",2015-05-11T06:00:02,['Rock'],7.5,Double Double Whammy,Eskimeaux: O.K.

42,A Musical History,['The Band'],"Expansive five-disc, 102-track box set sensibly features all of Music From Big Pink, plus nearly 40 songs either previously unreleased or previously unavailable on CD.
Under their singularly anonymous moniker, the Band consisted of four Canadians and one Arkansawyer, five accomplished musicians who could switch instruments as effortlessly as they changed musical styles: Richard Manuel (soulful vocals, piano, drums), Rick Danko (vocals, bass, guitar), Robbie Robertson (guitar, lyrics), Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, vocals), and Garth Hudson (organ, accordion, reed instruments, and everything else). A Musical History, the five-disc/one-DVD set executive produced by Robertson, follows the quintet from their roots in the Canadian rockabilly scene to Woodstock to The Last Waltz, distilling more than 15 years down to five discs and 102 tracks, of which nearly 40 are either previously unreleased or unavailable on CD. Pop artist Ed Ruscha painted the monochromatic portrait on the cover, and Rob Bowman contributes monographic liner notes, heavily excerpting his contributions from the 2000 reissues. As for the title, what other kind of history could there be? A Musical History proves much more definitive than any previous compilations, which typically start with the Band's first album; however, it's not the length of its tracklist, but the range, that counts. A Musical History begins with a one-disc prologue with tracks from The Band's previous incarnations-- Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, Levon and the Hawks, Bob Dylan's backing band, and Crackers.
The band that eventually became the Band paid their dues the old-fashioned way: they apprenticed themselves. It was Ronnie Hawkins who really taught them to ""play fuckin' loud,"" a tactic that honed their killer chops and barnstorming showmanship. Under Dylan's tutelage during his first electric tour they learned that their songs were not restricted by any particular structure, running time, or tradition and so could be whatever The Band wanted them to be. So listening to this first disc is like reading an accomplished writer's very first short stories: These songs reveal a hesitant, undeveloped voice that's not quite certain yet what's possible or permissible, but the music is cast in sharp relief by our knowledge of future accomplishments. Despite the inclusion of unreleased tracks uncovered in DJ/producer Duff Roman's basement (like the instrumental ""Bacon Fat"" and the caustic ""Leave Me Alone""), this is a slow, albeit valuable, chapter in the Band's history, peppered with some admittedly fiery numbers. ""Who Do You Love"" sounds like Hawkins is stirring up a riot and his band is trying to muffle it. And the live cuts of Dylan's ""Tell Me, Momma"" and ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" have a rough, obstinate grandeur that deflected all the boos the folk-purist audiences hurled at them.
Both Hawkins and Dylan were outsized personas who dominated the stage and often obscured the five musicians behind them. When they finally formed the Band, Danko, Helm, Hudson, Manuel, and Robertson opted for something a little more democratic (or like communism, as Helm remarks in his autobiography). The key to the Band was that no voice or instrument dominated, but still, everyone was doing something very interesting all the time. There are three distinct vocalists on Music From Big Pink and The Band, and everyone except Robertson trades out instruments. The result is a pair of albums that still sound simultaneously experimental and traditional, irreverent and respectful. Music From Big Pink is included on A Musical History in its entirety-- anything less would be a travesty-- but with the previously unavailable full-length version of ""To Kingdom Come"" (which leaves Hudson's organ solo intact) and an alternate take of ""Lonesome Suzie"". The Band is represented by about two-thirds of its tracks, with live or alternate versions of the remaining third.
It's no stretch to say this pair of albums marks the Band's peak-- blues, folk, jazz, rock, funk, soul, r&b;, and country and western all synthesized into twin monuments to the American music they'd been playing for nearly a decade in clubs, roadhouses, and honkytonks with Hawkins and in stadiums and basements with Dylan. Their early apprenticeships had given them everything they needed to make these albums, but failed to teach them how to deal with the ensuing money and success. It's all pretty much downhill from the final chords of ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come)"": The Band suffered in the limelight, which shifted their communal work ethic from collaboration to isolation. Drugs, poor reviews, and intra-Band ego clashes ravaged the group, making The Last Waltz seem like a logical, if somewhat preemptive conclusion.
Still, despite some dips here and there (especially Robertson's awkward storytelling on ""The Moon Struck One""), the final two disks prove the quintet remained a powerful unit, able to sculpt intricate songs that rambled and grooved. Allen Toussaint's mind-boggling horn arrangements on Cahoots and Rock of Ages-- the bulk of the fourth disc-- give songs like ""Life Is a Carnival"" and ""Don't Do It"" a hit of energy that enlivens the arrangements considerably. The Moondog Matinee covers are adventurous and irreverent: it takes temerity to add new verses to Little Junior Parker's Blue Flames' ""Mystery Train"", but the Band makes the new material sound like it actually belongs there. And Helm's enthusiastic vocals on Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry's ""Ain't Got No Home"" reveal a good humor and spiritedness that contrasts nicely with soberer songs like ""It Makes No Difference"".
The fifth disc includes ""Forever Young"", the only excerptable song from Planet Waves, along with two tracks from the Band's 1974 tour with Dylan: ""Rainy Day Women #12 & 35"" is noteworthy for its goofy ad libs, while ""Highway 61 Revisited"" barrels along with righteous hot-rod abandon. After tracks from the underrated Northern Lights--Southern Cross and the odds-and-ends Islands, as well as a few outtakes and rarities (like Rick Danko's exquisitely homesick ""Home Cookin'""), the set closes with three tracks from The Last Waltz: ""Evangeline"" with Emmylou Harris, a majestic version of ""The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down"", and ""The Weight"" performed with the Staple Singers.
And that's where A Musical History concludes, venturing no further than 1978, despite the fact that four of the five members continued touring as the Band during the 1980s. There are no tracks from those lonely tours nor from any of the members' various solo projects. Furthermore, Bowman's notes end well before they can consider the three decades between The Last Waltz and A Musical History-- the deaths of Manuel and Danko, the Band's diminishing legacy, or even the long-awaited official release of Dylan's show at the Royal Albert Hall. So this set doesn't provide a complete history, but its abrupt cut-off point seems unavoidable, perhaps even natural: The Band was no more or less than those five men, who were united in their mission to make music not as pop culture, but as American culture.",2005-10-25T05:00:03,['Rock'],8.7,Capitol,The Band: A Musical History Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1178-a-musical-history/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2005-10-25,-5.943835616438356,2005.75,0.0
43,Music Inspired by Philippe Garrel’s Le Révélateur,"['Mary Lattimore', 'Jeff Zeigler']","Harpist Mary Lattimore, who has worked with Thurston Moore and Sharon Van Etten, teams with mult-instrumentalist and War on Drugs producer Jeff Zeigler for a hypnotizing, semi-improvised score.
Every New Year’s since 2008, Texas’ Ballroom Marfa has invited musicians to provide a live score for a silent film. The fifth edition paired the harpist Mary Lattimore, who’s accompanied the likes of Thurston Moore and Sharon Van Etten, with the multi-instrumentalist Jeff Zeigler, a longtime engineer for the War on Drugs who produced their 2014 epic Lost in the Dream. (They’ve both worked with Kurt Vile). In Marfa, the duo scored Philippe Garrel’s 1968 experimental film *Le Révélateur, *which ultimately inspired a collaborative album called Slant of Light**. And now comes the release of their semi-improvised score as Music Inspired by Philippe Garrel’s Le Révélateur.
This collection presents two version of the score: a 45-minute album composed of 11 tracks, roughly split for each of the film’s scenes or major moments, and a version synced up to the film’s 67 minute runtime. Without the images, this is a fascinating entryway to Lattimore’s very unique way of playing. Her harp experiments make for perfect wandering music. You can hear strong echoes of her recent solo album, At the Dam, in this score.* *The ping-pong machine of sounds her harp makes with its array of effects pedals is no doubt hypnotizing. It’s a sound so multivalent and warped that it’s always made me want to close my eyes to digest the weirdness of it all (a hindrance, of course, to a project that is also visual).
Zeigler’s use of the melodica, especially in the song “A Tunnel,” strangely and successfully resembles the bold flourish of Ennio Morricone’s harmonica in his western scores. Throughout, it nearly haunts the background of Lattimore’s stray plucks. Zeigler’s synthesizer manipulations create ambient waves of noise that lend all Lattimore’s harp gymnastics an odd disembodied feeling. She responds in like by deploying delay pedals to elongate sounds and taps the body of the harp to use it as a drum. They also experiment with straight noise, in songs like “A Forest,” which is almost Glenn Branca-esque in its wall of dissonant tones.
When I did try to watch the film and listen to the score all at once, I was always just a little off, the film or the score always out of sync—human error framing it all. So watching Lattimore and Zeigler perform the score in person earlier this month, at Brooklyn’s Nitehawk Cinema, felt necessary. Lattimore set up at her 47-string Lyon and Healy harp on one end of the auditorium and Zeigler was behind a synthesizer, array of knobs, and melodica at the other end of the theater. Her harp was so large and grand that one of its wooden corners obscured the edge of the screen. The very physicality of the experience was overwhelming. Lattimore’s harp echoed and bounced off the walls at random angles, making the live sound a strange flickering presence that stuck with you as each new note lead into the next. The harp is a dramatic choice for the rather minimal and rather metaphysical film; it slathers across the story. Their score, in its own way, provides an alternative narrative for the silent film, because it creates a sense of drama and tension that is more openly up to interpretation.
The film is so intensely visual, so obliquely shot, and so very weird that the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze said *Le Révélateur *was a primary example of what he called the *cinema du corps *(“cinema of the body”). In his theory of film, *cinema du corps *was defined by a pronounced physicality, the cerebral faculties overwhelmed by the mass of sensations a film could produce (such as the awareness of the beat of your heart, or the ringing in an ear). When your body is able to fully internalize this, the experience of what Lattimore and Zeigler are doing is so one of a kind. But the profound difficulty of achieving the perfect experience makes the album a tad disappointing, with its disconnect between lived experience and what will always be just a recording.",2016-08-01T05:00:00,['Experimental'],6.9,Thrill Jockey,Mary Lattimore / Jeff Zeigler: Music Inspired by Philippe Garrel’s Le Révélateur Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22162-music-inspired-by-philippe-garrels-le-revelateur/,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2016-08-01,4.831506849315068,2016.5,0.0
44,Luxury Problems,['Andy Stott'],"Best new music
Working with operatically trained vocalist Alison Skidmore, the Manchester producer has humanized his sound, made it more beautiful and richer on the surface while further accentuating its dark heart. The new dynamic leads to another big leap forward.
Andy Stott took his time getting here. The Manchester producer spent a good part of the last decade turning out solid tracks under his own name and under the alias Andrea. Though he always returned to dub techno, he flirted with a range of genres, from juke to house to dubstep, and some of his music was very good. But Stott never quite zeroed in on a unique voice. That changed in 2011 with the release of two short albums, Passed Me By and We Stay Together. Stott left behind the quicker tempos of dance proper, and slowing down allowed him to sink deeper into his music, where he found a new world of atmosphere and texture. Passed and Stay were heavy records that highlighted something new about the expressive power of bass. Dub techno, stretching back to its origins with the early-1990s Berlin project Basic Channel, tends to view the low end as a mysterious black sludge. Where bass in Skrillex-style EDM is a precision weapon, with drops punctuating the tracks and jacking up the mood in an instant, the bottom octave in dub techno is more of an enveloping presence. It's murkier, more oppressive, colder, something you wade through and push against. Which is why the inertia of the relentless 4/4 beat signifies energy whatever the tempo.
On his two 2011 releases, Stott found an unusual musicality in deep, foreboding bass. His music throbbed with the sooty remnants of industry and had obvious appeal for those interested in dark ambiance of any stripe; its all-consuming nature gave him a new audience beyond the realm of dance music. With his new album, Luxury Problems, he adds a few more wrinkles, and his music has become simultaneously more complex and more accessible. Working with operatically trained vocalist Alison Skidmore (Stott met her as a student when she taught him piano), he's humanized his sound, made it more beautiful and richer on the surface while further accentuating its dark heart. The new dynamic leads to another big leap forward for the producer.
Skidmore's voice is a versatile instrument in its own right, but Stott's looping and processing gives it even more flexibility. Though Luxury Problems has a consistent overall mood, the feel and structure of the individual tracks vary quite a bit, and the pieces featuring Skidmore find her singing pulled into all kinds of interesting shapes. The album opens with her in her most glassy and ethereal, as repetitions of her singing a single word, ""touch,"" float through space like soap bubbles. The ""ch"" phoneme is looped and becomes the hi-hat on the track, and gradually the sounds assemble themselves into a ghosted version of a conventional dance rhythm. But when Stott's machine bass pulse enters just under halfway through, we realize we're in for a world of serious contrasts: ""Numb"" is delicate and gorgeous but has an undercurrent of menace, and the tension between these qualities is the record's essence.
If ""Numb"" is Skidmore at her most spectral, ""Hatch the Plan"" finds her sounding more grounded, almost in the mode of a singer-songwriter. The choral-like layering on ""Plan"" brings to mind School of Seven Bells and even Throwing Muses. But it's the longest track on the record and is purely instrumental-- mostly a deeply unsettling mix of bass churn and machine noises-- for its first two minutes. That it moves from pure soundscape to something close to a proper song is further evidence of Stott's confidence; none of these tracks feel like they have to be any one thing, they're always growing and changing and defying expectations.
""Lost and Found"" has a similarly melodic approach, unspooling in a Middle Eastern mode and bringing to mind Dead Can Dance at their most subtle. We can hear Stott drawing lines between 4AD-style gothic new wave and dub techno, building bridges between sounds and ideas based on his understanding of the elements and moods that connect them. Elsewhere, on ""Expecting"", he goes further into abstraction, constructing an intensely dark and ominous atmosphere that bring to mind the ice-cold isolationist drone of Thomas Köner. The excavation of electronic music history takes a more unusual turn on ""Up the Box"", which plays with a snippet of what sounds like the ""Amen"" break. But the familiar splash of jungle snares and cymbals is transformed by Stott into something of his own own, as he mixes the tricky rhythms with his now undeniable bass signature, a groaning maw flecked with distortion that feels like it's rattling everything within earshot. Stott has a rare ability to pull sounds from different places and fit them into his album conception.
Two records from the past offer antecedents for Stott's breakthrough: Luomo's Vocalcity and Burial's Untrue. It's not that Luxury Problems sounds like either of these releases-- the mood and textures are vastly different in each case. But there's a spiritual connection between the three, all of which found producers working within the confines of a specific genre of electronic music discovering a way to turn their music inside and out and broaden its appeal through the manipulated voice. But if Vocalcity was a digital refraction of house music and Untrue took early UK dubstep as a jumping-off point to express post-club emptiness and yearning, Luxury Problems is more internally focused, an evocative and immersive soundtrack for a sustained look within. It's the headphones album of the year from a producer with a long history who has come into his own.",2012-10-29T06:00:00,['Electronic'],8.7,Modern Love,Andy Stott: Luxury Problems Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2012-10-29,1.0726027397260274,2012.75,0.0
45,Young Hunger,['Chad Valley'],"The debut LP from Jonquil frontman Hugo Manuel's Balearic pop project features guest vocal spots from Twin Shadow, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, Active Child, Glasser, El Perro Del Mar, and others.
In 2008, Guardian music critic John Burgess wrote optimistically about the comeback of Balearic pop, citing producers like Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas as proponents of its revival. Last year, in the same publication, Simon Reynolds blamed the genre's transformation into an ""overall banging boshing feel"" for the decline of Top 40 pop, with ""Dynamite"" by Taio Cruz acting as the main offender. Listening to Chad Valley's debut LP, there's evidence for both Burgess and Reynolds' respective arguments: ""My Girl"" lifts a lyric from the Spice Girls' ""Wannabe"" almost verbatim, but ""Fall 4 U"" exemplifies Burgess' platonic ideal of Balearic, with Valley's voice curling like a saxophone against a pillowy, gently propulsive backbeat. On the other hand, you have the wince-inducing title track, which renders ""banging boshing"" 80s synth bass and wooden blocks in lurid colors.
""There's a hell of a lot of really awful pop music, and I actually really like it,"" says Hugo Manuel, the electronic producer behind Chad Valley and frontman of Oxford-based tropical pop group Jonquil. ""I've grown up thinking pop was such a dirty word with bands like Steps, which will never even be ironically cool or good in a retro way."" For the most part, however, Young Hunger's fat bass, bongo breakdowns, and Manuel's bell-like tenor sound closer to 1980s and 90s balladeers that might never be ironically cool or good, like Billy Ocean (especially on ""Young Hunger"") or George Michael.
In contrast to the cool Biggie bounce of Equatorial Ultravox's ""Reach Lines"" and the beach boombox-thick ""Ensoniq Funk"", Manuel sounds earnest on most of Young Hunger. After announcing, ""Tell all your friends/ Tell everyone/ That all that I can think about is you,"" he closes ""Tell All Your Friends"" with an ""ay-ee-ay-ee-ay"" that's definitely more Taio Cruz than Prins Thomas. A few songs later, as smooth as Al Jarreau atop a bed of Peruvian flutes, he tells guest El Perro Del Mar, ""You know I want to do this together/ You know I want to go far."" She gamely responds, ""You're so excited,"" with the coyness of the female part on Next's ""Too Close"".
The many guests on Young Hunger prevent the album from getting too bogged down in schmaltz, adding color and texture to the record. Album opener ""I Owe You This"" features Twin Shadow's George Lewis Jr.-- who, like Manuel, was tagged as chillwave until this year's Confess earned comparisons to bands like the Human League-- whose gritty lower register offsets Manuel's high, pure voice, but matches it in emotional weight, something that can't be said for Orlando Higginbottom of Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs' part on ""My Life Is Complete"".
The only track on which Manuel doesn't appear vocally (aside from the instrumental ""Interlude"") is ""Fathering/Mothering"". It's a simple track, contracting with heavy beats and minimal atmospheric synthesizers as Anne Lise Frøkedal of Norwegian band Harry's Gym carries verses about the womb. It also builds differently than the rest of Young Hunger, getting louder and faster in the way that Chad Valley's older material did, Frøkedal singing, ""Getting louder than the sun."" After the rest of the album's clutter of neon-hued effects, ""Fathering/Mothering"" provides welcome space.
""Manimals"" closes Young Hunger, a similarly sparse and serious track featuring Active Child's Pat Grossi. His is the closest-- and slightly superior-- vocal match to Manuel, but his voice is shrouded in echo, as though he doesn't want to outdo him. Like Lewis Jr.'s contribution, it doesn't really add or detract anything vital from the record, but it's a nice touch among many. It's as though Manuel's afraid to let his numerous contributors take the spotlight, too often cluttering their voices with synthesizer effects. These flourishes generally add up to a record that's, as Manuel suggests, ""good in a retro way,"" but when Chad Valley loosens his grip on the keys and lets space rather than noise carry his songs (""Fall 4 U"", ""Manimals"", ""Fathering/Mothering""), the album soars instead of floats.",2012-10-29T06:00:03,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",7.0,Cascine,Chad Valley: Young Hunger Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17210-young-hunger/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2012-10-29,1.0726027397260274,2012.75,0.0
46,Hammers and Anvils,['Graeme Downes'],"The title of this album might conjure images of a blacksmith plying his trade: pulling metal from a seething furnace ...
The title of this album might conjure images of a blacksmith plying his trade: pulling metal from a seething furnace and banging it into a useful shape. But as with any trade, the mark of a true craftsman is the ability to make the difficult seem effortless. In this light, Graeme Downes can be considered a craftsman as well. For Downes, his furnace is a piano and the sheet music scattered across his floor like dying sparks. We imagine Downes with a pencil wedged behind his ear, working diligently on song after song, trying to perfectly place each note on the pages. Over the course of fifteen years and six albums, Downes managed this impossible task with his old band, the Verlaines. Now, with Hammers & Anvils, he crafts these songs only for himself.
Out of all the Flying Nun Records alumni (including more influential groups like Tall Dwarfs, the Chills, and the Clean), the Verlaines were the most regal and refined. Sure, the songs would march along in that strum-happy fashion that became synonymous with the New Zealand underground, but then a string section or a vocal chorus would enter the fray, taking the song in an unexpected, wonderful direction. The best Verlaines songs combined Downes' two capital music influences: his academic musical studies (formerly a student of classical music, he's now a lecturer at New Zealand's Otago University), and his rock music roots. Regardless of whether the songs featured distorted guitars or oboes and clarinets, Downes' lyrical romanticism remained constant and fervent. Comparisons could be made between the Verlaines and the Wedding Present, but where David Gedge seethed and raged, Graeme Downes would sigh and swoon, even at his most frenzied.
Hammers and Anvils isn't much different from his Verlaines output, except for its lack of grandeur, which is easily explained by the fact that Graeme played all the instruments here (which include guitar, piano, trumpet, and clarinet) and co-produced the record. The milieus presented range from just Downes and his guitar (on the opening title track) to a full-band arrangement with a digital orchestral backing (on ""Rock and Roll Hero"").
Though there are a few aggressive, rockier numbers (like the band-like ""Alright by Me"" and ""Cattle, Cars, and Chainsaws""), these are the exception. The solitary nature of this album is best exemplified in its quieter moments, like the piano balladry of ""Mastercontrol,"" or the Tin Pan Alley saunter of ""Cole Porter"" and ""Getting Out of It."" Not surprisingly, it's in these quieter songs that Graeme's wary romanticism is best expressed-- in ""Cole Porter,"" he confesses to be ""like Fred Astaire with concrete in my shoes,"" while the ethereal ""Shoreleave"" offers a different sort of confession: ""I'd trade the world and all its storms for four walls in your arms.""
In some ways, Hammers and Anvils may be the most accomplished album of Downes' career. The range exhibited throughout these thirteen tracks shows the mind of a truly skilled craftsman at the top of his game. If there's a criticism that can be leveled at craftsmen, though, it's the fear of one's mastery overwhelming the desire that originally led them to pursue that craft. In this instance, there's no need to worry of such loss. But why take it from me, when Graeme says it himself:
Now don't try explaining
Why no love can change me
When the whitecaps drop diamonds
I gotta dive down to find them",2001-09-26T05:00:03,['Rock'],8.5,Matador,Graeme Downes: Hammers and Anvils Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2434-hammers-and-anvils/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2001-09-26,-10.026027397260274,2001.5,0.0
47,Shadows on the Sun,['Brother Ali'],"Fist. Skin. Blood. Cheers. This would prove to be a common sequence of events for the greatest boxer in history ...
Fist. Skin. Blood. Cheers. This would prove to be a common sequence of events for the greatest boxer in history, Muhammad Ali. While sports historians never forget to mention his ability as a fighter, most will recall that he partially made his name by talking shit. From one Ali to another, the tradition continues. This time in the visage of a young Brother with two red eyes, pale white skin, a black soul and what I believe can safely be called one of the year's best albums.
A Molotov cocktail of Nas' chipped-toothed storyteller, Slug's introspective emo-thug, and Common Sense's wordplay aficionado, Brother Ali has clearly studied the album structures of mid-90s masters. From the urine-soaked authenticity of his portrayal of inner city Minneapolis life (""Room with a View"") to the staggering detail of a conflict with his wife-beating neighbor (""Dorian"") to a bass monster spiritual alloy of The Legion's ""Jingle Jangle"" and Atmosphere's ""Flesh"", where he claims to be ""a cross between John Gotti and Mahatma Gandhi"" (""Bitchslap""), Ali focuses his powerful delivery equally on reality-based depth charges and classic rap braggadocio. In this regard, Brother Ali truly is the bad motherfucker his nom de plume ancestor was. On ""When the Beat Comes In"", he claims to be, ""A big teddy bear/ Until they scream 'stop slamming the car door, that's my fucking head in there!'"" and, subsequently, tells an invisible adversary that he'll ""serve your family and write about it in my journal like I'm Mr. Belvedere.""
Brother Ali made a name for himself through freestyle competitions and mind-blowing live shows, and this energy translates well to the compact disc format. His greatest power lies within his sedimentary flow. His rhyme schemes skit and scat across instrumentals like pebbles breaking waves on the beach, while his sheer force-of-will cadence drags this album into the upper echelon. When Ali tells you that he's ""walking tall enough to make your half-moon whole,"" he says it with the confidence of a man that just stuffed the ballot box.
Although the focus is consistently directed to Mr. Ali's magnetic delivery, props must be given to Atmosphere's Ant for his most consistent production to date. While his work with Slug has typically been hit (""Flesh"", ""Guns and Cigarettes"") or miss (""Tears for the Sheep""), this album is more or less flawless instrumentally. Clearly influenced by the RZA, and more recently, Rocafella associates Kanye West and Just Blaze, Ant has finally surrounded his single drumkit with samples that distract from his trademark headphone-destroying snare. The cheery church organ flourish of ""Forest Whitaker"" and the ridiculously smooth flute-guitar battle of ""Star Quality"" both exemplify Ant's sudden willingness to diversify his portfolio.
Granted, not every beat is completely rock solid, and some of the most interesting tracks end far too quickly (""Forest Whitaker"" was a verse away from being the best song about living with Albinism ever, while Ali's collab with Slug, ""Missing Teeth"", sports one of the best beats on the album, but only lasts for less than two minutes), but when these kinds of minor issues are an album's only shortcomings, you tend to look past them. Shadows on the Sun one-ups Ali's already sick debut, and proves him one of the first great voices to emerge from the underground so far this century.",2003-08-14T05:00:01,['Rap'],8.7,Rhymesayers,Brother Ali: Shadows on the Sun Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1066-shadows-on-the-sun/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2003-08-14,-8.143835616438356,2003.5,0.0
48,Olympic Mess,['Helm'],"Luke Younger's music as Helm fits loosely into categories like ambient, drone, noise, and industrial, but is not reducible to any of them. Olympic Mess is his most colorful and structured release, and at its best it gives you the feeling of listening differently.
A sense of unease characterizes Luke Younger's music as Helm—sonically and also, perhaps, conceptually. His music fits loosely into categories like ambient, drone, noise, and industrial, yet in interviews, he takes pains to stress that it's not reducible to any of those descriptors. His music is frequently darkly foreboding, but he insists that it isn't ""intentionally dark,"" as he told The Wire, and he is careful to keep the usual industrial clichés at arm's length: ""I've never played with suggestive or dark imagery. You'll never see a graveyard on the cover of one of my records."" And while his music depends heavily upon field recordings and acoustic sources, it warily maintains its distance from the physical world.
Olympic Mess is Helm's fourth release for Bill Kouligas' PAN label, following the 2012 album Impossible Symmetry and subsequent Silencer and The Hollow Organs EPs. The new album stems from a period in which Younger says that he immersed himself in ""loop-based industrial music, dub techno, and Balearic disco,"" but take that backstory with a grain of salt. If his music isn't ""intentionally dark,"" it definitely isn't intentionally any of those things, either. Olympic Mess turns out to be much more interesting, precisely because it remains so hard to pin down. It might be slipperier, even, than his previous work, despite the fact that Olympic Mess is his most structured record yet. Beneath the hazy, abstracted shapes, there's a sense of flow and a sense of purpose. As in the best abstract art, nothing feels haphazard or merely random; every burble, blip, clang, ping, chirp, and whoosh is a voice in a vast symphony. There's no doubting that there is a kind of logic at play.
While murky rumbles remain a primary reference point, the album is shot through with light and color. Virtually all of the album's tracks thrive upon the tension between shadows and shimmer, and the latter wins out again and again. The 12-minute ""Outerzone 2015"", the album's centerpiece, moves gradually from rain-barrel clang to scrapes and whines, creating accidental harmonies as it throws off sparks. The title track, running watery loops against a high-pitched buzz, is also surprisingly dulcet, and almost delicate; you wouldn't think that there was a way of linking Kompakt's Pop Ambient series with Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, but here we are.
Olympic Mess is full of elliptical loops that give the music its shape. Sometimes they churn along unaccompanied; elsewhere, they throb in concert with other loops but out of sync with them, creating a wild, oceanic push-and-pull. But the music is never defined by its rhythms, and none of its tracks feature a steady pulse from beginning to end. Instead, tiny micro-currents bubble up from the depths, play out for a spell, and are eventually subsumed. At its best, and when heard in the right headspace, Olympic Mess gives you the feeling of listening differently.
Only one track seems out of place: ""Strawberry Chapstick"", a four-minute spoken-word sketch read—not, it seems, by Younger—in an almost inaudible whisper, the mic crackling and popping like a campfire. It appears to be a long scrap of found footage, and its mundanity (""I'm 22 years old […] I am 5'8"", my whole family is pretty tall […] I'm a musician—I don't make a living playing music but I do play a couple instruments"") jerks you out of Younger's finely wrought illusions and zaps you back to the real world. Olympic Mess speaks volumes without utilizing language or conventional musical tropes; it's an experience so captivating that language only breaks the spell.",2015-06-15T06:00:04,['Electronic'],7.2,Pan,Helm: Olympic Mess Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20642-olympic-mess/,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2015-06-15,3.7,2015.25,0.0
49,The Glow Pt. 2,['The Microphones'],"K Records reissues Phil Elvrum's quiet masterpiece, a record of intuitive music and esoteric flights of the imagination. The set also features bonus material recorded in 2007 specifically to accompany this release.
In the latter half of the 1990s, as the grunge and riot-grrrl movements of the Pacific Northwest petered out, a young record store clerk in Anacortes quietly dreamed up a world that was entirely his own. Working in private, with analog tape, Phil Elvrum remade the twee-pop of Olympia, Washington's K Records into something broader in scope, proving that intimacy and opulence were not mutually exclusive by forging sweet tunes, childlike vocals, solar noise, and enigmatic tape collages into one molten mass. His speciality was reconciling extreme orders of magnitude, casting mountains and planets and stars as items hanging from a baby's mobile. The Glow Pt. 2, which remains his crowning achievement, is being reissued by K just as Elvrum says ""it threatened to go out of print."" Seven years of imitation have done nothing to dull its impact-- it sounds as unaccountably grand now as it did in 2001.
The Glow Pt. 2 wasn't conceptualized, then recorded; Elvrum figured out where it was going even as he committed it to tape. He strived to document the esoteric flights of his imagination, and produced appropriately intuitive music: Vocal harmonies blur, disappear, return as ragged organs. Creaky percussion sounds like it might give way at any moment, and sometimes does. Staticky thumps that could level forests give way to calm acoustic expanses. The bum notes peppering the acoustic riff of ""Headless Horseman"" are reminders that Elvrum was lunging impulsively from one idea to the next. In this, it's a perfect mirror of Xiu Xiu: While Jamie Stewart's music fumbles in pitch darkness, Elvrum's gropes through blinding light.
That easy but deliberate rhythm, along with Elvrum's mossy production, makes The Glow Pt. 2 feel uncommonly organic. Many of his songs move with the naturalistic but formalized cadence of an iambic meter. ""I Want Wind to Blow"" is cut by a heartbeat, plunked out on an acoustic guitar's low E string. The hardier pulse of ""The Gleam Pt. 2"" turns pitch-shifted guitars into a stately march. These could have been average indie pop tunes were they not shaped by Elvrum's unique sense of non-linear arrangement and space: He often gives us a few moments to acclimate ourselves to the Dub Narcotic studio's seething room tone before, with a sudden flourish, flooding it with energy, as he does on ""Map"" and ""My Roots are Strong and Deep"". Therefore, everything he records sounds huge and hollowed out, a little bigger on the inside than on the outside. Death Cab for Cutie would have written the frilly arpeggios of ""You'll Be in the Air"" and stopped there, but Microphones fans wait on tenterhooks for the moment when it inevitably shudders and begins to pile up on itself.
Bonus discs are typically the province of demos and remixes. Because of The Glow Pt. 2's piecemeal construction, Elvrum has none of the former-- everything was taped over or went on the album. As something of an artistic hermit, he's constitutionally inclined against the latter. But, wanting to give fans something in addition to the existing songs, Elvrum spent some time in 2007 recording bonus material for the reissue. These additions range from the obvious (like the acoustic version of ""I Felt My Size"") to the arcane (like a vaguely dub-influenced version of ""I Want Wind to Blow""). There are also essential sketches of new material such as ""I'm Like You, Tree"", which expand the album's already-deep relationship to nature. Of course, none of the new lyrics clarify the overarching story; they're further snapshots of Elvrum feeling small and serene in a big, scary universe. But these snippets are thrilling for Microphones fans-- they reveal a few more glimpses of a distant, haunting world that's all the more alluring for its incompleteness.",2008-04-04T06:00:01,"['Experimental', 'Rock']",9.3,K,The Microphones: The Glow Pt. 2 Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11352-the-glow-pt-2/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2008-04-04,-3.5,2008.25,0.0
50,LP,"[""d'Eon""]","Following last year's split with Grimes, the Montreal musician releases an LP, a sprawling collection that explores extremes of spirituality in a digital world.
In his brief career to date d'Eon has marked himself as a curious prospect. He is part of an exciting new scene of mostly electronic musicians in Montreal; including Purity Ring and Grimes (with whom he released a split EP last year). Like those two artists, d'Eon's approach has an esoteric bent to it, and on his new full-length, simply titled LP, he investigates two extremes of spirituality: He explores ideas of tradition and religion, pitting them against a modern self trapped at the top of a Facebook profile or communicating via iPhone.
For the most part, the questions LP poses are the ones you might ask yourself everyday when turning on your computer, but they also seem to be issues that haven't been explored that much in music. James Ferraro pushed some of the same buttons on last year's Far Side Virtual, but Ferraro's approach felt a bit more ironic, or tongue-in-cheek. d'Eon's struggle with the online world and spiritual identity seems to come from a place of real soul-searching.
The near-10-minute closing track, ""Al-Qiyamah"", is a high point, and the most successful illustration of d'Eon's concept. He frames the track with a question right away: ""If we're stuck in here, what happens on Judgement Day?"" It's a dramatic sentiment but one equally applicable on a small scale, too: At what point does ""real life"" intersect with online life? The track is held together by some of the best production on the record: Swirling, iridescent synths keep pushing with forward motion before a breakbeat consumes the song at its halfway point. That beat eventually degrades, sounding almost like a chip tune by the time it rubs against a new age synth line at the end. Fittingly, it ends with the static of a phone signal interrupting a speaker frequency.
Elsewhere, the density of LP does the record no favors-- it clocks in at a mighty one hour and 13 minutes-- and you almost wonder if there's some sort of meta point being made about saturation on the internet. Musically, LP isn't strong enough to sustain this weight, and the length makes what should be an interesting concept seem at times rambling and forced. Songs like ""Transparency Pt. II"" drag things down especially-- scanning like a babbling Tumblr entry and tapping into a Kevin Barnesian level of unearned excess. As such, LP's a little frustrating. There are some challenging and interesting ideas at its core along with spots of very good production, but ultimately the lack of self-editing makes the sprawl too difficult to truly access.",2012-06-06T06:00:05,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",6.4,Hippos in Tanks,d'Eon: LP Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16683-lp/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2012-06-06,0.6753424657534246,2012.25,0.0
51,Strange Little Birds,['Garbage'],"With their post-return jitters under control, Garbage have solidified that return with Strange Little Birds, their darkest, most intimate LP and the band’s strongest effort in 15 years.
Garbage would sooner risk obsolescence than fake a smile. The industry learned this the hard way in 2001 when they tried to steer the band back to the mainstream following the commercial failure of their third record Beautiful Garbage, released three weeks after 9/11. Hoping for a smooth transition onto the pop-and-rap-glutted charts, label executives approached frontwoman Shirley Manson and producers-slash-bandmates Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and Butch Vig demanding rapped guest verses and pop hooks. They got the same old Garbage instead: seething, surging, brutal–Billboard potential be damned.
Fifteen years later, Garbage have outlasted the naysayers and jilted ex-lovers. 2012’s Not Your Kind of People* couldn’t match the sonic cohesion and thrills of 1995's self-titled debut *and *Version 2.0, *but as the band’s first effort in seven years, it also provided an oasis for all those jaded by EDM's brainless, bro-y #posivibes. With their post-return jitters under control, the band have solidified that return with Strange Little Birds, their darkest, most intimate LP and the band’s strongest effort in 15 years.
Manson's been happily married for six years (her husband, Billy Bush, co-produced this album and its predecessor), but she’ll never get over misery, her lifelong muse; like all Garbage albums, *Strange Little Birds *obsesses over, romanticizes, and even celebrates sorrow. On the lead single “Empty,” she towers over her bandmates’ roaring void with arms akimbo, underscoring her woe by way of dramatic, elongated syllables; “I’m *sooooo *empty,” she moans, quaking atop Vig and Erikson's steeled groove. “Night Drive Loneliness,” a ballad inspired by a piece of fan-mail thrust into Manson's hand following a Garbage gig in Russia, develops its titular subject as a sensual ritual. Considered in tandem with the track’s slinky lounge arrangement and boudoir imagery (“I got my high heels/and my lipstick/My blue velvet dress in my closet”), Manson's sighing refrain–“My night drive loneliness comes again and again”–hints at a more hopeful subtext: perhaps depression's just another nameless paramour occupying the passenger seat, another car whizzing by in the night.
Of course, the same could be said for love. Every glimpse of romantic bliss on *Strange Little Birds–the galvanizing lust on “Magnetized,” the stolen glances of “We Never Tell”–ultimately dissolves under Manson’s fatalist approach to matters of the heart. Although she’s come a long way from the paranoid interrogations of the Bleed Like Me *era (“I think you’re sleeping with a friend of mine/I have no proof, but I think that I’m right""; “Why Do You Love Me?”) the front-woman still regards love as a rigged game–one she’s happy to play, because she’s got nothing else to lose. Midway through the album, on the funereal choruses of “Even Though Our Love Is Doomed,” Manson soberly proclaims the song’s titular sentiment to deliver a message of hope, not fear: “Even though our stars are crossed/You’re the only thing worth fighting for/You’re the only thing worth dying for.” Elsewhere, “Sometimes” and “Amends”–Strange Little Birds’ respective opener and closer– fashion Manson's philosophy into an olive branch extended to her already-“doomed” loves: “There is nothing you could say/To cause more hurt, or cause me shame/Than all the things that I have thought about myself,” she admits.
*Strange Little Birds *lands less than a year after Garbage’s 20th-anniversary reissue of 1995’s landmark self-titled debut, and while the new album’s sessions predate Garbage’s commemoration festivities, their temporal and stylistic overlap sets it apart from the similarly-styled but unevenly executed band have released over the past fifteen years. Indeed, the  sonic parallels between the two albums are frequent, and far from subtle: “Empty” and “Supervixen” share the same glam-industrial DNA, and the dreary “Blackout” employs the same skittering trip-hop showcased in “A Stroke of Luck.” Despite these superficial similarities, repeat spins of Strange Little Birds ultimately belie an older, wiser reincarnation of that youthful rage, not just a cheap retrospective. Twenty years on, Garbage are still grappling with their demons, but they’re disarmingly zen–even ecstatic– about the battle. With material like this, they’ve got a right to be.",2016-06-10T05:00:00,['Rock'],7.0,STUNVOLUME,Garbage: Strange Little Birds Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21953-strange-little-birds/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2016-06-10,4.689041095890411,2016.25,0.0
52,Ultraviolet,['Kid Sister'],"After three years of work, the once-anticipated Kid Sister album finally sees its release.
Ultraviolet doesn't sound like an album nearly three years in the making, but that's what it is. Chicago party-rapper Kid Sister dropped the breezy nail-salon jam ""Pro Nails"" in spring 2007, and the song went viral when Kanye West showed up for a superstar cameo. Kid Sister's spent the intervening years recording a debut, scratching it, starting over, tinkering, and finally coming out with the product she really wanted to release. And it's... a 40-minute, 12-track dance-rap full-length without a single hard punchline or trenchant moment, the sort of thing that sounds like it could've been banged out in a couple of weeks. Turns out this isn't the hipster-rap Detox.
Fortunately for Kid Sis, Sparks-addled party rap has not, as a genre, advanced much since ""Pro Nails"". A number of the tracks on Ultraviolet became blog favorites years ago, but beyond that, the album sounds about as current as it would've if she'd cranked it out in a timely manner. In fact, the record comes considerably less stuffed with ideas than, say, Spank Rock's YoYoYoYoYo or Fannypack's So Stylistic, years-old albums that covered similar stylistic ground but twisted and sputtered and wriggled as much as they could've without leaving their dancey, lightweight wheelhouses. Those albums came equipped with a restless, inventive sense of fun. Ultraviolet, for the most part, just sits there.
Production-wise, Ultraviolet is a dance album, not a rap album. The beats, from folks like XXXchange, Sinden, and boyfriend/label boss A-Trak, blow by at frantic but assured clips, picking up and then discarding little melodic ideas as they go. We hear a lot of ravey, diffuse synth stabs and compressed Ed Bangery blurts. ""Big n Bad"" stops just short of jacking Europe's ""Final Countdown"" synth riff. ""Let Me Bang 2009"" rests on a pretty cloud of keyboards. A few moments of hammy melody call up memories of cheesed-out 90s hi-NRG Euro-dance, stuff like Vengaboys or DJ Sammy. But the only time the album's musical palette shifts in any significant way is on ""Switch Board"", where Chicago juke producer DJ Gant-Man uses the same ingredients to push a more frantic, furious idea of party-rocking. When Kid Sis and Gant-Man abandon rapping entirely near the end and resort to barking out dance instructions and party-chants, it's like finally.
Kid Sister is not a great rapper, or even a good one. She spits out all her words with a nasal, scrunched-up, exaggerated pronunciation, the kind of thing that reminds me of actors in teen movies rapping for laughs. When she attempts punchlines, the results are pretty grisly: ""Boy, you got a problem? Holler at Dr. Phil/ I'll put a hurting on ya and I do it in some heels."" She barely stays on top of her beats, and she never switches up her cadences. Lyrically, she rarely steps far outside her favorite subject-- partying-- or even implies that much life exists beyond it. After three tracks of ""yeah, let's dance"", it's almost a relief to her her come with ""Step"", a song about flirting with an overly aggressive dude in a club-- still a song about partying, mind you, but at least a slightly new aspect of it. Kid Sis's hipster-circuit party-rap has always been a weird and barely acknowledged corner of the rap universe, but the subgenre's best rappers (Spank Rock's Naeem Juwan, for instance) radiate the same intensity that all good rappers do-- the idea that they have to keep rapping or they'll fall to pieces. Kid Sister doesn't have that.
And as she shows on Ultraviolet's best moment, she doesn't necessarily need to lean on it. My favorite song on the album is the one with no rapping whatsoever. ""You Ain't Really Down"" is an irresistible little piece of freestyle/electro revisionism, Kid Sis working a surprisingly nimble singing voice over a pinging, bottom-heavy track. Even though she's singing about being heartbroken, there's a fun approachability in her voice, and she multitracks in some new jack swing backing vocals that remind me of ""Motownphilly"" more than anything else. An album of Kid Sis singing songs like this might be worth a three-year wait. An album like this one? Not so much.",2009-11-17T06:00:02,['Pop/R&B'],4.4,Downtown,Kid Sister: Ultraviolet Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13684-ultraviolet/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2009-11-17,-1.878082191780822,2009.75,0.0
53,My Moment,['Tee Grizzley'],"The debut mixtape from Detroit’s Tee Grizzley argues for him as a sober, sincere street rapper with the potential for some crossover success.
There are 13 songs on Tee Grizzley’s debut mixtape, My Moment, but the first three minutes alone will convince you of the young Detroit native’s exceptional talent. With no instrumental, the 23-year-old beats out a drum pattern on a kitchen table, snaps his fingers, and adds his own harmonies to a rhyme about the stomach pains and betrayal he felt while serving time in two states. It drips with pathos: “I sat there and waited/For niggas to help me/All that talking they did, them niggas ain’t show it/I sat there and starved/I remember the hunger.” My Moment was written during Grizzley’s incarceration, and argues for him as a sober, sincere street rapper with the potential for some crossover success.
Prior to his time in the spotlight, Grizzley, born Terry Wallace, was sentenced to 18 months for second-degree home invasion in Michigan and nine months for a jewelry store robbery in Kentucky. The former charges stem from his time at Michigan State University, where he studied accounting and finance; an acute financial crisis of his own inspired him to raid a series of dorm rooms before being caught with nearly $20,000 worth of cash and electronics. This was February 2014. Grizzley was released pending an investigation and then fled to Kentucky, where he was eventually picked up during that botched jewel heist.
All told, Grizzley’s legal troubles only lasted about two and a half years—a far cry from the 30 years he claims to have been initially offered in a plea deal. As he raps on his breakout single, “First Day Out,” which is included here: “My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower/I told them crackers, holla at me when they sober.” My Moment frequently feels like a series of formal exercises, someone taking his mind off of his immediate circumstances by diving into his work. “Catch It” could slot into most rap radio playlists, perhaps between Big Sean’s “Bounce Back” and Future’s “Fuck Up Some Commas.” “Country” is like a rapid-fire resume for Grizzley as a technical rapper, and the hook on “How Many” sounds as if it could be a reference for Ty Dolla $ign.
Speaking of those technical points, Grizzley follows in the long line of Detroit rappers whose syllables frequently spill out on either end of the bar. It’s a careening, freewheeling flow, where phrases are expanded and contracted seemingly at random, but where the sum total is a near-perfect groove. (If you’ve ever heard a Big Sean song and wondered why he’s rapping off-beat, he isn’t—he’s approximating this very approach.) There’s a bonus effect to this. A song like “Day Ones,” with its more perfectly coiffed delivery, stands out as a departure on My Moment, where on an industry-trained rapper’s record, it might get lost in the din.
As great as some of the new songs on My Moment are—see “10K”’s bounce in particular—“First Day Out” remains Grizzley’s masterwork. It’s as defiant as could be expected for a song he recorded in the same clothes he was wearing as he left prison, but it’s also somber, an elegy for those left behind behind bars or for those already departed. “First Day Out” is extraordinarily dense with names, nicknames, and references to real people in Grizzley’s life, to the point where quoting its lyrics feels invasive. Maybe that’s what’s so enrapturing about My Moment: despite Grizzley’s newfound buzz, and despite the commercial aspirations betrayed by some songs, the tape feels like it was made for his friends and family, a love letter to everything that brought him to this point, good and bad.",2017-04-25T05:00:00,['Rap'],7.2,300 Entertainment,Tee Grizzley: My Moment Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23184-my-moment/,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2017-04-25,5.563013698630137,2017.25,0.0
54,INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass,['Goldie'],"Something was stirring the cobwebs in my brain, that's for sure. The Hippie thought I'd strained something, but ...
Something was stirring the cobwebs in my brain, that's for sure. The Hippie thought I'd strained something, but I knew it was Goldie. As INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass piped through my speakers and 'phones, I began to think of another album-- Urbal Beats 2.
Y'see, 1998's UB2 was a double-disc compilation of skillfully DJ'd tracks that served a higher purpose. Disc One was nu-skool, fresh hits and Disc Two brought back some fat-ass gems from the vault, again proving that old techno isn't necessarily bad techno. INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass works on a similar premise-- Spectrum (Disc One), splits drum-n-bass into a wide range of colors ranging on the new side, most tracks coming from '97 to '99. Goldie's Metalheadz label is represented heavily-- tracks by Alex Reece, Doc Scott and Codename John give way to acid-jazzy compositions like Digital's ""Space Funk."" It's comprised of tight, well-chosen tracks that stretch boundaries instead of pants.
INCredible's second disc, Retro, recalls the Disc Two of UB2. It's largely composed of older tracks that sound, frankly, like a walk down memory lane. I remember back in the day when ""Terminator"" was on all the floors. Used to be, you could got a pill for just $10 bucks back then, but half'd kill ya. In any case, even if you haven't necessarily heard all of these tracks in this mutation, you've likely heard pieces of them sampled on other songs. Goldie contributes not only 1993's ""Terminator"" but 1994's ""Manslaughter."" He also brings Neil Trix, Optical, J Majik, Source Direct and Matrix, mixing house-fun sensibility with live drum-n-bass intensity to pleasing effect. But as with UB2, the older sounds almost surpass the newer material-- the hindsight of a couple of years provide clarity for Goldie's vision.
In short, INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass is for the following people:
Old people trying to fit into their baggy pants
Pacifier-suckers whose teeth have fallen out
Youngsters that are curious about ""the old days"" but want a disc of new stuff, too
The bi-curious: those willing to try drum-n-bass, but frightened of the ""harsh stuff""
Worshipers of the Metalheadz crew, Goldie, and the jungle/techstep way
It is not for the following people:
Your mom
The lady downstairs whose breath stinks of cigarettes and coffee
People in search of relaxation
Swing dancers
Baba booey
That's it. Move along. Nothing to see here.",2000-01-04T06:01:40,['Electronic'],7.3,Columbia,Goldie: INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3509-incredible-sound-of-drum-n-bass/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2000-01-04,-11.754794520547945,2000.0,0.0
55,Jessica Rabbit,['Sleigh Bells'],"Sleigh Bells’ fourth record is a hodgepodge of clashing sounds and concepts that’s united only by its indiscriminate maximalism.
Having watched the shelf life for buzz bands grow ever shorter during the late ’00s, Sleigh Bells seemed to understand the need to make the most of their moment. In the wake of their breakthrough debut Treats they worked fast, firing off a couple more LPs within a year of each other, as if trying to refuse the world the chance to forget about them. Though it suffered the inevitable diminishing returns expected from a band that got everything right the first time around, 2012’s Reign of Terror nearly matched the blunt force of their debut, while distinguishing itself just enough with its arena-rock lean. But by their third effort 2013’s Bitter Rivals, the sugar rush had become a headache. The album was genuinely obnoxious in a way its predecessors had only pretended to be, and almost as troubling for a band whose power stemmed from their laser focus—their resolve to drive a single idea, brick on the gas pedal, head first through any obstacle in its path—it was strangely noncommittal.
For their fourth album, Sleigh Bells did something inherently risky for a band so of-the-moment: They took their time, piecing together Jessica Rabbit in stops and starts over three years, and it sounds like it. Recorded in part with Mike Elizondo, the seasoned Los Angeles producer best known for glossing up records for Eminem and his Shady/Aftermath cohorts, it’s a hodgepodge of clashing sounds and concepts that’s united only by its indiscriminate maximalism. Anybody holding out hope for another great, singular inspiration to strike the band again the way it did on their distortion-addled debut probably won’t find it even worth a cursory stream. What the album lacks in vision, though, it attempts to compensate for through sheer exertion. If nothing else, the duo has never seemed to be trying harder than they are here, so although Jessica Rabbit is even more scattershot than Bitter Rivals was, it at least has a sense of showmanship that album didn’t.
The album also smartly runs with the one thing that Bitter Rivals did right: giving more control to singer Alexis Krauss. Krauss had always been the face of Sleigh Bells, their head cheerleader and fun ambassador. Her past as a member of a teen-pop band was central to the group’s mythos, their link to the very music they were subverting. But as integral as she was to the band’s image, Treats didn’t give her all that much to do. Derek Miller’s compressed guitars were so loud, so blown out, that often all Krauss could do was play against them, injecting her airy voice here and there, and even then mostly to make the guitars feel that much heavier in comparison.
On subsequent efforts, Krauss has dialed up the ferocity to the point where she’s no longer juxtaposed against the fray—she is the fray. And as she takes on increased songwriting responsibilities on Jessica Rabbit, she’s also seized the chance to show off her full vocal range. On “Rule Number One,” her voice climbs from a Kesha sneer to a robust Xtina wail as she belts “POP ROCKS AND COKE MAKE YOUR HEAD EXPLODE!” over Miller’s hair-metal riffage. Somehow, she’s even louder than the guitars.
While Krauss relishes the opportunity to play the pop star she never got an actual chance to be, Miller succumbs to a reduced role. His spliced guitars propel “Crucible,” an admirably spirited mashup of circa-’87 Whitney Houston and Licensed to Ill-era Beastie Boys, but it’s hard to even guess what hand he might have had on the Elizondo co-production “I Can Only Stare,” a guitar-free, high-drama pop number closer to something you’d find on a Leona Lewis record than anything on Treats. Similarly, the brooding, EDM-tinged “Unlimited Dark Paths,” as with far too many Elizondo productions, sounds like it was somehow conceived with Skylar Grey in mind.
Even when Jessica Rabbit treads into generic territory, Krauss manages to leave a personal stamp on the material. “I was dreaming of a dead end street that we used to run down,” she sings on “Lightning Turns Sawdust Gold,” over a slinky, lighter-waving groove more than a little inspired by Santigold’s “Disparate Youth.” Elsewhere she calls out a partner who wastes a Friday night getting high and watching The Lion King, the kind of specific, seemingly autobiographic detail that rarely made its way into the first couple Sleigh Bells records. She takes ownership of these songs in a way she never did before.
So Jessica Rabbit is Krauss’s show, and she’s a show worth watching. The problem is it’s just not very catchy. On their first two albums, Sleigh Bells always had a granite hook to balance out the volume. But too many of these songs are just bluster in search of a purpose. Casualties of the duo’s noncommittal approach, they fall into a thankless gray area, too tinkered-over to function as punk, yet too haphazard to be great pop.",2016-11-08T06:00:00,['Pop/R&B'],5.9,Torn Clean,Sleigh Bells: Jessica Rabbit Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22571-jessica-rabbit/,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2016-11-08,5.102739726027397,2016.75,0.0
56,Rat Conspiracy,['Unwound'],"Best new reissue
The new Unwound box set Rat Conspiracy collects the Seattle punks' 1993 LP F**ake Train and 1994's New Plastic Ideas along with a third album of 7” singles, radio sessions, compilation appearances, and unreleased tracks from the raw, formative years of the band.
There were dead rats in the walls of Steve Fisk’s Avast! Studios in Seattle, recounts the liner notes of the new Unwound box set Rat Conspiracy, when the trio of drummer Sara Lund, bassist Vern Rumsey, and singer-guitarist Justin Trosper convened there in March of 1994 to mix their album New Plastic Ideas. After hours upon hours at the board, it got to be too much. Mingling with the perpetual pall of stale cigarette smoke in the studio, the stench of decomposing rodent was so bad that Lund had to run outside just to catch her breath.
Murky, anxious, asphyxiating: That’s the atmosphere *New Plastic Ideas—*and its 1993 predecessor Fake Train—conveys. The Olympia-based band had recorded and aborted what would have been their debut 12” in 1992, originally slated for the new local label Kill Rock Stars, but drummer Brandt Sandeno had quit before it could come out. The album was shelved (later to be released as Unwound, included in the recent Kid Is Gone box set) and Lund was brought aboard. Her liquid, unhurried drumming only added to the group’s gooey undertow. Old songs were scrapped and new ones written to accommodate this uncharted chemistry. It seemed to seep everywhere at once—grunge, pigfuck, indie-rock, post-hardcore, punk—collecting residue as it went along. In a decade where anti-packaging was the ultimate irony, Unwound cloaked itself in the dirty earnestness of necessity.
Rat Conspiracy collects Fake Train and New Plastic Ideas along with a third album of 7” singles, radio sessions, compilation appearances, and unreleased tracks from 1993 and 1994. Together they comprise Unwound’s first true statement. It’s a garbled one. From the lazily sadistic whiplash of “Dragnalus” to strangulated stasis of “Feeling$ Real”, Fake Train lurches, twists, and turns in on itself, as if manifesting some perverse, extended metaphor for the feedback that laces nearly ever track. “I don’t feel strange/ I don’t feel at all”, Trosper mumbles on “Dragnalus” like a kid made to stand in the corner. Then he screams his fucking face off.
That drift between hesitance and horror underscores “Lucky Acid,” in which Trosper’s vocals wander in as if the mic got turned on too late; soon the muted jangle of his guitar swells into a Morse-code distress call banged out on naked nerve endings. And the trilogy of “Valentine Card”, “Kantina”, and “Were, Are and Was or Is”—Fake Train’s own “The Wonder”, “Hyperstation”, and “Eliminator Jr.”—not only mimic Sonic Youth in structure, but in the delicate, dissonant, Daydream Nation-esque instrumental “Were, Are and Was or Is”. But Rumsey’s blood-chugging bass line on “Valentine Card” is pure Jesus Lizard, even as Lund’s impressionistic percussion dots the rhythm.
There’s sausage being made here, but gristle keep clogging up the grinder. “Ratbite”, the album’s lone hardcore song, comes on like an homage to Wire’s “1 2 X U” as filtered through Minor Threat and a broken bottle of Robitussin. Vintage punk gets more directly referenced on the bonus track “Census,” a cavernous noise spasm from 1994’s “Negated” 7” that ends with a sample of Billy Idol’s goofy line “A heavy heavy dub, punk rockers!” from the throwaway Generation X song “Wild Dub,” a dub version of their 1978 song “Wild Youth.” Echoes of echoes of echoes—yet with Unwound they congeal into a fugue of fucked-up signifiers as thick with collagist subversion as Fake Train’s Tom Jones-on-Sun Ra cover art.
Of the remaining bonus tracks, “Unsympathetica”, “Untitled 1”, and “Untitled 2” are previously unreleased. All three are napkin-drawn blueprints for songs that never were. Together they shed light on Unwound’s shambolic writing process, a jam-based unraveling of knots of ideas rather than an act of construction. “Untitled 2” goes so far as to verge on start-stop, hard-rock swagger, more the area of expertise of Unwound’s close friends and contemporaries Karp. The sludge-shoveling “Mkultra”, from the 7” of the same name, could have even been a Karp cover. Rat Conspiracy’s only actual cover, though, is of the Minutemen’s “Plight”—and its throbbing atmospherics, entwined voices, and elegant spirals of abrasion are treated as both tribute and birthright.
New Plastic Ideas is less a product of its input and more of a refinement of its lack thereof—a process of weeding out, as it were, regarding Unwound’s blatant inspirations (Black Flag very much among them). There’s a huge leap in articulation here, both in gesture and enunciation, from Fake Train. “Entirely Different Matters” masters one of Trosper’s guitar trademarks, a layered, symphonic squeal of opening feedback, while “Usual Dosage” does the same for another, the crystalline dissonance of harmonics. But the dynamics refuse to lapse into patterns, as the pinpoint noise-squibs made predictable by Fugazi are deployed with counterintuitive chaos. On “Envelope”—one of Unwound’s most indelible songs, a study in inverted, charred-hearted near-pop—melody morphs into menace and is never resolved. By the time the seven-minute sprawl of “Abstraktions” (which features Fisk on keyboards) veers down a harrowing, Side-Two-of-Joy-Division’s-Closer corridor, the shape of Unwound to come has been all but sketched out.
Seeing Unwound in a freezing warehouse in the mid-90s was glimpse into that future. Wrapped in ratty scarves, playing with fingerless gloves, their breaths curling like smog in the frigid cold, they lugged around with them a miasma of sourness. Their music didn’t move the air in the room so much as curdle it. Their records to date—meticulously overdubbed, immaculately raw—had not been ample warning. What the hell was going on? This was a DIY punk show; it was supposed to feel in some way collective and cathartic. Instead—like Lund in the mixing room during the New Plastic Ideas sessions—those of us in the sparse audience were struck numb and left gasping for oxygen. Unwound had sucked it all in, stunk it all up, fed it back to us as a sad, blackened racket.
Fake Train and New Plastic Ideas hold important places in the history of 90s music, not to mention those of punk and indie as a whole. And they set the tone for unimagined Unwound greatness to come (which will be chronicled in subsequent volumes of the box-set series). But those two albums, and the tracks that accompany them on Rat Conspiracy, transcend time, place, attitude, and even the sprawling continuum of influence. More than any other records of their generation, they embody a paradox that disaffected youth has been stabbing at since the advent of rock ’n’ roll: how it feels to be cocooned among strangers in utter alienation, yet stand as one.",2014-03-13T06:00:01,['Rock'],9.1,Numero Group,Unwound: Rat Conspiracy Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19090-unwound-rat-conspiracy/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2014-03-13,2.4424657534246577,2014.0,0.0
57,Keyboard Fantasies,['Beverly Glenn-Copeland'],"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s masterwork from 1986, a hermetic and wondrous new age album that contains worlds beyond worlds.
Just off of U.S. Highway 37 in Sylvania, Ohio, lies a small, butter-colored hamlet of retirees. Its name, “Sunset Village,” suggests that you or your loved ones will enjoy a warm, bucolic, well-reckoned end, should you choose to settle there. Like all retirement centers, Sunset Village comes with a lot of practical provisions: The age for admittance is strictly greater than 55, the majority of properties are for rent, rather than purchase (for obvious reasons), and, based on your need and price point, staff can cater a menu of care options under heartbreaking titles like “memory support.” What comes free and without caveat, however, is the tacit understanding among its people that colonies like these will very likely serve as their last earthly stop before deboarding this mortal coil.
Not unlike all-inclusive resorts or monasteries, senior communities are among the most meaningful attempts we’ve got in the sustained pursuit of pinning and freezing time. These are societies interested in life existential, not life chronological. They acknowledge the end at their outset, make peace with the idea of transience, and build entire ecosystems designed to strip life of its formal trappings. Seeing them from this angle might clarify why the often-used, flourishy euphemism “active living community” can feel so bizarre and science-fictional—it throws into relief what sort of living the rest of us do in the meantime.
In a satisfying and totally arbitrary coincidence, there exists another sunset village at the end of an equally strange and otherworldly cassette released in 1986. Like the album that houses it—and very much like the Ohioan villa of the same name—“Sunset Village” (side B, final track) also happens to be an arcadian resting place that holds the question of time, and its movement, at its center. The song is fundamentally just a short poem paired alongside a simple synthesized piano melody—not very far from something you would use to hush a baby. Each time I find myself replaying it, I’m freshly amazed by how accurately it manages to recreate the wooziness so inherent to bliss, heartache, or finality, how it definitely holds some spiritual dominion with the fish of the sea and birds of the air, and, with just 11 words, how it teaches the intricate idea that wisdom is just another word for knowing what to accept. It will also bring your pulse rate down to about 40.
The artist responsible is Beverly Glenn-Copeland, a man endowed with such rare fortune that he remained more or less a non-entity to the music-curious public until the age of 72 when a particularly influential record collector from Japan sent him a life-altering email asking for any remaining physical copies of his early music. Deep into a peaceful, years-long toil in the Canadian hinterlands with his wife, Copeland was suddenly faced with the task of living his way out of a placid, relatively private existence, and into one in which documentarians tour his home like a museum and take seriously his thoughts on the intersection between science and the divine.
Newfangled global interest for Copeland, as you might imagine, is unimaginable. Under the rough and ridiculous circumstances of any life, the fate of late-bloomed fame holds unique surprises. Watching artists like these confront contemporary milestones of success, like good streaming metrics or outpourings of online support, seems to give them an expression permanently set to stupefied. The sizeable hill of praise that’s been furnished onto him across the last two years—mostly from a growing sect of left-field record collectors, a gaggle of celebrities, and those lucky enough to have been gifted URLs to his music by wise friends or lovers—carries a uniformly grateful, even devotional air of protectiveness. “Mostly, I’m eating my Wheaties and all my vitamins so I can perhaps live long enough to finish what it is I’m supposed to be doing here,” he admitted during a lecture two springtimes ago in Montréal.
Chalk Copeland’s recent boom up to the inscrutable forces of destiny that slowly pull upon a person over the course of their life. Chalk it up to the easy digestibility, maternal swaddle, and mental asylum so inherent to the sort of music that we now call new age. Chalk it in no small part up to Copeland’s own journey of self-discovery as a transgender man that now aligns neatly with the triumphant contemporary attitude toward publicly articulating one’s complicated identity. Regardless of what exactly set off the recent Copeland rumble, his is a coming-of-age story probably most due to his dreamy, boundless frontierism that sees no encroachment, no fear, and no distinction between anything resembling a beginning or an end. In some ways, it’s a story of inevitability. It may be because his life seems to be governed by, and has always been governed by, a sunset village from the outset.
Despite an especially twisty and sometimes glum biography, Copeland appears as serene and composed as a friendly monk. In lieu of robes, his daily uniform includes a button-down shirt, a pair of puffy, pleated chinos, and a scrub of chin fuzz the tint of a long-boiled egg. As seen and heard in the groundswell of videos and interviews with him across the last two years, as well as in harder-to-find footage from more than two decades ago, his voice leaves his mouth with a pleasant moisture—like he is somehow always on the end of a spoon of peanut butter—and is elastic, as prone to characters and impressions as a puppeteer’s. Age and circumstance have made his tone slightly darker, richer, and honeyed the cooler vibrato he had in his 20s, but the thermostat of his manner seems to have always been set to warm.
“Father was a brilliant European classical player,” gargles Copeland at the top of his 2019 biopic, also titled Keyboard Fantasies, throwing his head back on a chair and treating the word like mouthwash. Since “cradlehood” (his own charming term), Copeland seems to have been equipped with the twin gifts of promise and idiosyncrasy. His mother, Georgie Willis, who was a formidable pianist and an even more formidable academic, bears the honor of being the first Black woman to complete a graduate program at Penn State University. The pathetic pace of American integration in the 1940s, however, meant that though she could legally attend classes, she was denied the right to live on campus. Fate would install a generous Quaker woman in Mrs. Copeland’s path, who she would go on to live with—thereby allowing her to continue attending Penn State—but the very friendly neighbor would also go on to spiritually move Georgie with the pacific doctrines and credos of Quakerism. It’s why the Copelands joined a Quaker congregation in Philadelphia shortly thereafter, and why Glenn found himself reared in the safety of a community that gave him the clearance to exist in an alternate, sheltered dimension distinct from the more fraught realities that stained so much of Black childhood in late Jim Crow-era America.
Georgie held hope that, upon entering a large and foreign city away from the security of their Quaker eden, her child would be seen by the public as both normal and non-threatening. Copeland immediately torpedoed this idea upon entering McGill University in Montréal by becoming the ultimate disaster: He wore his hair afroed, entered into a same-sex relationship, and was introverted to a degree of hermitude. It also probably didn’t help that he was studying European classical music with a penchant for a particular German style called lieder, which sounds a little bit like opera sung by loud, sad angels. To be out, Black, bizarre, and 17 in 1961 was an open invitation to get one’s ass kicked not only literally, but legally: It would be eight more years until Canadian Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau would decriminalize consenting homosexual partnerships (34 years before every state in America would do the same).
“At one point,” Copeland says, with the comfortable, breezy tone of someone who has a high capacity for empathy and a near non-existent one for resentment, “my family ganged up on me and forced me into a car and took me to a physician who was going to have me interred in a hospital.” The plan was to give Copeland the then-fashionable electroconvulsive therapy in an attempt to zap the gay out of his head and heart. Others might have treated this episode like a hostage situation, a mortal betrayal, or both, but Copeland, in a flush of grace toward himself and his family, quietly rose from the bed, gathered his stuff, and jogged out the front door before anyone could notice.
Once Copeland returned to Montréal, he got serious about getting serious with music, and decided he had had enough of McGill. He dropped his classes and descended upon Toronto, settling luckily alongside a manager and league of total strangers who, he was delighted to figure out in studio sessions later on, made up a small league of Canadian jazz heavyweights. Alongside men like bassist Dough Bush, electric guitarist Don Thompson, drummer Terry Clark, and principal guitarist Lenny Breau, Copeland committed his first noodlings to permanence.
Though the two albums he made in the early ’70s were commercial catastrophes, his eponymous 1970 work is a piece that leaves me fundamentally confused by its exclusion from most modern canons. The folk is freaky. The riffs are seraphic. With all the leider residue in his arias and tremolos, these albums feel like songbooks of spirituals for the unspiritual. There have been obvious parallels made to Joni Mitchell in the music’s blueness and timbre—especially in how Copeland warbles like god has just asked him a difficult favor—but a more fitting comparison would be to Judee Sill, an artist who shares with him an alloy of Christian folklore, Bach-indebted chord progressions, and a sense of servitude to a quiet, inarticulable secret. “By and large, the early music was looking at death, love and the difficulty of love,” he once indifferently summed, though I would argue that a track like “Untitled (Make the Answer Yes),” is the sort of song that one could sensibly choose to be buried to.
Blindness toward negativity, unfounded optimism, and curious guilelessness are traits not often blent in the same adult in 2020, but at the center of this Venn diagram lives the broad idea of being “childlike.” Copeland is definitely childlike—strange, virtuous, glib, and peaceful—in myriad and impressive ways. The documentary devotes one longish scene to his ritual of enjoying a cup of apple juice before each performance, and it seems, per the frequency of its use in nearly every one of his interviews, that his favorite word is “magic.”
It only seems natural that Copeland would have had a career as a sort of jester with a synthesizer on a few children’s television shows while between albums. Young Canadians in 1973 might recognize him costumed in polyester alongside straw-haired, rosy-cheeked, anemic little puppets on Mr. Dressup, a show analogous to (and in fact hosted by the understudy of) the American Mister Rogers. But his work on Dressup meant that he was somewhat in the public eye—and at the time, he performed and lived as female “Beverly,” which made it doubly difficult to reconcile the unplaceable and unsolvable dissatisfaction he carried around. “How would you do that?” he asked of a journalist in 2005. “Walk in one day as Beverly Glenn-Copeland and come back two weeks later as a changed being? I just couldn’t figure out how to do it.”
It’s not that Copeland didn’t understand that his body was at odds with his brain at that point, but it wasn’t until 15 years after his initial work on Dressup that he found the language and the wherewithal necessary to give expression to an idea he knew was true since infancy. He was laying on the sand, reading a book, “and I just kind of sat up and went, ‘I am transgender.’ And I had never put those words to it.” In 2002, long departed from Dressup and armed with the fortitude to answer his private riddle, Copeland publicly transitioned to male.
The author Andrea Long Chu—a writer, who, in the past few years, has become exceedingly good at substantiating the quandaries of trans personhood for mainstream audiences—puts the amorphous feeling of dysphoria into lucidity by calling the lifelong sensation a “vague but maddening sense that something is off about the world.” In other words, gender incongruence is a slippery yearning, a “hunger without appetite,” a strange, evanescent idea of an achievable but permanently just-out-of-reach reality. It should make a lot of sense that the successful juncture between what seemed like fact, and what seemed like fantasy, would form the central thrust of Copeland’s masterwork, Keyboard Fantasies.
In 1983, he traveled to a small cabin in a sleepy village three hours north of Toronto. Ordained by his manager to go off and write something good, he bought and hauled along an Atari computer and two synthesizers—the Roland TR-707 and the Yamaha DX7—eagerly awaiting the prospect of holing up, shoveling snow, and playing with his new machines. Copeland views computers with appropriate humility (“I would walk around and go, ohhh, because I couldn’t do anything with them,” he once said) but feels tantalized, paralyzed by the alternate realities unlockable within them.
It’s difficult to overstate how aggressively synthesizers in the ’80s were marketed as portholes to the future—ad copy for incoming makes and models would spend paragraphs positioning them as “Products of the Space Age,” alongside taglines like “Science Fiction? No: Science Fact!” Deep inside the machines were near-to-life versions of the instruments Copeland had studied and honored for so long, but at a supernatural slant. “There were sounds that were acoustic, sounds that only a computer could make, and sounds that could come from a violin,” he explained, but only “if you used a lot of imagination, or squinted your ears.” To Copeland, his machines represented the impossible made perfectly possible. When he first laid eyes on an Atari, he says, “it was like, ‘Oh, so this is the beginning.’”
If we emerged from the primordial soup with keytars in hand, Keyboard Fantasies is what our tribal lullabies would sound like. After weeks of sleepless tinkering with his toys, the album was born as a sextet of chuggy, spare, somnambulant pieces built by some of the most basic preset tones from the DX7. The DX7 offers a unique, and, at the time, enthrallingly new alphabet of programmable sounds—so much so that the instrument would go on to feature in most conceivable pop in the ’80s, from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack to work by Whitney Houston—but here, the galactic, plummy, and utterly standard “electric piano” setting was put to work across Fantasies’ six tracks, each of which sound like ancient, foundational plainsongs from a dimension not far off from our own.
Keyboard Fantasies seems to pureé wisps of cultural sounds into a new Pangea. “Ever New,” the opener, has vibratos as operatic as a lovesick Persian ode, lyrics as if from a self-help pamphlet found in a Bolinas co-op, and pentatonic scales with ascending intervals as spare as Japanese Shōmyō folk. “Winter Astral”—a totally voiceless Rothko of a song—reminds me of Buddhist breathwork in the intervals between Copeland’s lingering pressure on the keyboard. “Old Melody,” a piece that carries the joke of its sheer existence as false indigenous music in its title, is as lucid dream-inducing as alien cradlesong. Like a project under the long-celebrated and well-documented “Fourth World” music umbrella described by frequent Eno collaborator Jon Hassell, Fantasies is filled with “unknown and imaginary regions,” each one helmed by its peaceful and sole inhabitant, Glenn.
It’s curious that Copeland has been referred to as an “outsider” artist in recent reviews and breathless press releases. On the one hand, it does seem like a natural, knee-jerk description: the characterization of some art as “outsider” is a term usually ladled onto work that’s seen as unknowing of its own power, either through the artist’s lack of formal training, or a by the nature of its unpretentious existence outside of hoary art-historical canons. More often, however, it’s a title given to those who work in isolation, who have no profit motive, or, in many cases, are marginalized out the gate by their own identities (poor, Black, queer, et cetera). Though Copeland has said that Fantasies carries the “innocence that was part of [his] experience at the time,” there is nothing untrained or undisciplined about it. Classically educated and formally fluent, I suspect it is more a shorthand used because we lack the language to identify something that seems like it accidentally dropped onto Earth.
“Sunset Village,” the album’s denouement, is so extraterrestrial, it might single-handedly explain the confusion. The ballad is less a song as it is a viewpoint—a lot like the vertiginous sensation you might feel when looking out of an airplane window onto a quilt of land thousands of feet below. Strangely comforting, sidereal, and on the thin tightrope between alienating and familiar, it’s the strongest unconscious paean to Copeland’s fascination with science fiction. He’s spoken about finding particular calm in the works of David Brin and Isaac Asimov, but not exactly in the mass-market editions interested in slime apocalyptos or glowing squids from Saturn. Instead, Copeland prefers a notion of sci-fi that’s treated more as a defined, earthbound school of thought—one Asimov would clarify in a preface to Octavia Butler’s short story collection, Speech Sounds, the same year Copeland created Keyboard Fantasies. “Science fiction,” Asimov wrote, “is committed neither to marvels nor to disasters. It deals with possible situations.” For as strange and faraway they sound, “Sunset Village” and Keyboard Fantasies writ large present a quiet desire not exactly for escape from this world, but to imagined likelihoods on the most alien planet of all—this one.
The idea of elderhood is of enormous significance to Copeland. He mentions it frequently in the documentary, and it crops up reliably across interviews. On several occasions, he salutes “the elders” of the community in Huntsville, Ontario—where his snowy studio was housed—that ""took care of [him]” in the hours of his most vigorous synthesizer mania. The second-most affecting scene of his documentary comes during what looks like a casual Q&A, when a young devotee takes a microphone and thanks Copeland for the honor to share the floor with—gesturing toward Glenn—“our trans elder.” “Ahhh,” intones Copeland, nodding softly, visibly experiencing some sort of apotheosis. “Mmmm.” He takes a beat that feels like a decade. “You think in ways that it’s taken years for me to come to,” he says. “It’s about knowing things I don’t know.”
At the far end of several generational gaps to his fanbase, Copeland is aware that there is much more he is unaware about, but there are at least a few things that come with surety. In the documentary’s most unforgettable sequence, Copeland sits peacefully in a metal chair and sobs. It’s moving for a number of reasons, but largely because it seems cruel to have Copeland cry on camera. “I’ve figured out what I’m supposed to do,” he says. “I’m supposed to support these young people.” It firms an idea he once directed to a room full of wide-eyed, hungover fans in an interview released earlier the same year. “Do not fail to give your hearts. Do not fail,” he intoned, nodding toward the crowd. “I’m going to be watching you all from another dimension.”
That exact image happens to live on the album art for Keyboard Fantasies. On it, there’s a photo of a stained glass window in wedges of lemon, blue, and plum, framing a silhouette that looks a lot like the back of Copeland’s head facing out onto a shore. It’s too perfect—if nothing else, sight and solace have always been Copeland’s anima. In a life steered by the trying-on of new and strange vantage points, the cover works like a skylight to the clarity of his vision: one unburdened by any system, any path, any idea beyond inhabiting himself most accurately.
 
Stare at that window long enough and you can start to imagine everything—the sea, the sky, the sand, even Copeland—in a state of total suspension, deepened by the light of a sun that seems like it takes forever to set. He has never really needed much to grant him fullness. We’re so obviously the ones that do.

58,Poison,['Bell Biv Devoe'],"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a 1990 R&B blockbuster that bridged the gap between new jack swing and hip-hop soul.
They’d been talking about Bell Biv DeVoe for four minutes straight, and Ralph Tresvant was getting pissed. All six members of R&B group New Edition were back together, sitting on BET’s black leather “Video Soul” sofa for an interview, and these three guys who usually sang backup for Ralph—Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe—wouldn’t shut up about their little hip-hop side project.
Tresvant decided to interrupt and set it straight. “Mike keeps stressing BBD—it’s not a BBD moment,” he said. “It’s a New Edition reunion.”
This was 1990, and the trio’s debut single “Poison” was on the verge of breaking into the Top 10. Their album, also called Poison, had just dropped, and it was on its way to selling 4 million copies. By the end of the year, Billboard would declare BBD the biggest new pop group of 1990. It was definitely Bell Biv DeVoe’s moment.
Poison was a conceptually groundbreaking pop album that reinvented the relationship between R&B and hip-hop for the ’90s. BBD even had a neat little mission statement to explain their vision: “Our music is mentally hip-hop, smoothed out on the R&B tip with a pop feel appeal to it.” They stamped the slogan on their album cover and flashed it on screen during their videos. They talked about it in every interview, including that day on BET. The show’s host wasn’t sure what to make of it: “And like...what does that mean?”
Ricky Bell spoke up: “You have to listen to the music to understand what we’re talking about.”
You’ve heard “Poison” too many times, probably at a wedding or a school dance or some perennially bad episode of “Carpool Karaoke.” But Bell Biv DeVoe is more than just a song, and their debut album represents a critical leap in the evolution of R&B. A collaboration with revered Public Enemy production crew the Bomb Squad, Poison embodied the style and sound of hip-hop in a more convincing way than any R&B album before it. For better or worse, Bell Biv DeVoe set the stage for three decades of singers who want to talk, dress, and act like rappers.
Back when he was only 14, Michael Bivins introduced himself to the world with a little rap on New Edition’s 1982 breakout hit “Candy Girl”: “She walks so fast, she looks so sweet/She makes my heart just skip a beat.” The group made smiling, bubble-gum electro-pop, but Bivins had the cool confidence of a rapper, even if he was stuck singing background vocals most of the time. As New Edition grew from boys to men, embracing a sophisticated sound on their 1988 album Heart Break, Bivins was quietly establishing his hip-hop credibility.
On the 1989 single “N.E. Heartbreak,” Mike foreshadowed the BBD attitude with a more aggressive rap style:
Strolled in the party, walked to the bar
Playing incognito like I ain’t no star
F-F-Fellas looking jealous
And girlies looking horny
Saw a foxy young lady—her man was corny
In the song’s music video, Bivins rolls through the party with Heavy D as his wingman. Months later, Biv appeared in Eric B. & Rakim’s gritty black-and-white video for “In the Ghetto,” walking down a dark alley with the God MC and his crew. “The engine for Bell Biv DeVoe was Michael Bivins. He had a vision for the group,” said Hank Shocklee, leader of the Bomb Squad and the producer who would help shape Poison. “New Edition was all about wearing suits and dressing upscale. Michael brought it back to the street realm. They really brought out the hip-hop element by wearing Timberland boots and sagging pants. This is what gave the group their visual look.”
At the 1989 Soul Train Awards, New Edition took the stage wearing grown-and-sexy tailored suits—except for Bivins, who was rocking a gold chain, green baseball hat, and baggy green leather pants. He had played his role for seven years, but now that Tresvant and Johnny Gill were going solo, the questions had started: What are you gonna do? Bell and DeVoe were in the same position. As the New Edition tour was ending in the summer of 1989, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis suggested they start a trio: Bell, Bivins, and DeVoe.
Louil Silas Jr., the executive VP of black music at MCA Records, did not want Bell Biv DeVoe to make a rap record. “Louil wanted to have them back in suits like they were still in New Edition,” remembered producer Alton “Wokie” Stewart. Wokie and his partner Timmy Gatling were fresh off producing sophisticated R&B singer Christopher Williams when Silas asked them to record with BBD. The sessions produced a pair of safe, sensitive slow jams, “When Will I See You Smile Again?” and “I Do Need You,” that appear at the end of Poison. They feature zero rapping, a saxophone solo, and a seductive quiet storm monologue.
“(Mainstream black music) doesn’t deal with the kids on the street anymore,” Shocklee said at a black radio conference in 1988. “It’s now being made for people who drive Mercedes, not people who ride the buses.” More and more radio stations were advertising their “no rap” programming policy, despite the fact that young people were buying a ton of rap records. Tone Loc’s 1989 hit “Wild Thing” became the top-selling single of the late ’80s, but one in six radio stations refused to play it because “the program directors dislike rap music or found the song sexually suggestive,” according to Billboard.
Public Enemy was the biggest thing in rap, but their music got no love from quiet storm R&B radio. In 1988, frontman Chuck D wrote a cover story for Black Radio Exclusive, a radio trade magazine, in which he criticized the black radio industry for ignoring hip-hop. “Rap gives you the news on all phases of life, good and bad, pretty and ugly: drugs, sex, education, love, money, war, peace… you name it. R&B doesn’t do that anymore,” said Chuck. “R&B teaches you to shuffle your feet, be laid back, don’t be offensive, don’t make no waves because, look at us! We’re fitting in as well as we can!”
“Hip-hop and R&B were in two separate spheres, two separate universes,” said Shocklee, who invited BBD to work with the Bomb Squad, which also included his brother Keith and programming wiz Eric “Vietnam” Sadler. At their first session in late 1989, Ricky, Mike, and Ron were all dressed up, looking like they came straight from a New Edition show. To break the ice, Keith Shocklee brought them up to the “hip-hop spots” in Harlem to shop for new clothes—jeans, sneakers, and t-shirts. When they came back, they were ready to make some rap music.
Based on their strengths, Shocklee assigned them roles: Ricky would be the singer, while Mike and Ronnie would stick to rapping. “For me, it was about crafting a sound [where] the rappers and the singer could co-exist together,” Shocklee remembered in 2015. “The rapping and the singing had to be married together.”
In the ’80s, collaborations between rappers and singers were mostly cookie-cutter—the singer would perform the chorus and verses, and then the rapper would jump in during the break or the intro for a quick verse. The result still still felt like an R&B record, just with a brief rap interlude, as heard on LeVert’s “Just Coolin’” (featuring Heavy D). Some R&B acts had started pulling double duty and adding their own raps, like Bobby Brown on 1989’s “On Our Own,” but it was still very rare for R&B singers to appear on hip-hop songs. BBD’s arrangements broke the rules by pairing rapping and singing together within a single verse, making rap-free radio edits impossible.
The first voice you hear on “Poison” is Kool G Rap, the wildly influential Queens MC who helped create East Coast gangsta rap. G Rap shouts “poison!” at you 38 times throughout the track, a sample from his own 1989 song “Poison.” The voice was like a dog whistle for hip-hop heads that immediately gave BBD a hardcore edge.
The poison in this story is, of course, a woman. On the song’s chorus, Bell warns listeners to “never trust a big butt and a smile,” a line that’s jacked from another hardcore rapper, KRS-One. Mike and Ron both call girls “hoes” in their rap verses—a daring move for two clean-cut boy-band members—while Bell’s doo-wop harmonies keep things civilized. The cool walking bass echoes LL Cool J’s 1987 hit “I’m Bad,” and the iconic rapid-fire snare pattern is a blunt rendition of new jack swing’s signature rhythm.
“Poison” was written and produced by Elliot “Dr. Freeze” Straite, a Brooklyn producer and aspiring artist who shared a manager with BBD. But several musicians have claimed credit for helping to shape the track, including Hank Shocklee. “When it came to me, the record was very mellow and laid back,” Shocklee said. “I had to take it and give it a boost and pump it up. Besides changing kicks and snares, I wanted to make sure it had some power and punch. The drums had to be loud. When you hear the intro to the song, that’s what set the whole song off.”
The Bomb Squad crew only received production credits on three songs, but Shocklee says he actually remixed most of the songs so they would feel more hip-hop and have a cohesive feel. Minus the two out-of-place slow jams at the end of the album, every song on Poison is deeply committed to the mission of hip-hop fusion. The Shocklee-produced “Ain’t Nut’in Changed!” and “Let Me Know Something?!,” are the album’s most overtly hip-hop moments, bringing the golden era’s chopped funk aesthetic to R&B. These aren’t hip-hop-influenced new jack swing beats with typical mega-loud snares and orchestral synth stabs—they’re straight up hip-hop beats with samples flying everywhere and some singing on top.
The highlight of Shocklee’s sessions with the group is “B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)?,” which became Bell Biv DeVoe’s second No. 1 R&B single. Shocklee created the record after trying to imagine what Teddy Riley would do with BBD, imitating the hype, breakbeat swing of Riley’s hardest-hitting club bangers for Big Daddy Kane, Wreckx-N-Effect, and Heavy D. The lyrics on Poison are largely pretty light-weight party raps, but BBD were not pop rappers like Milli Vanilli or Technotronic—their music feels of the culture. Biv even came through with some slick nautical wordplay:
Yo, I love being a bachelor
Ricky said, “Yo, that girl’s a good catch for ya”
She and I choose to cruise in my love boat
My waterbed, kept us afloat
When it came to BBD’s controversial hit “Do Me!,” DeVoe swiped his lyrics without permission from an aspiring teen rapper named Busta Rhymes who he’d met the studio with Shocklee. Musically, the song is a pretty typical new jack swing affair, but lyrically, it pushed the envelope of sexuality in R&B. Ron—who was 22 at the time—tells a story about committing statutory rape (“backstage, underage, adolescent...”), while Mike brings some light S&M to the party: “Ooh, that booty/Smack it up, flip it, rub it down, oh no!” It’s hard to ignore three horny dudes chanting “do me, bay-bayy” with orgasmic moans as background vocals.
The song was a huge hit, despite disrupting R&B’s polite, euphemistic relationship with sex. The “smack it up” line in particular prevented some radio stations from playing “Do Me!,” but the song still received heavy rotation on MTV and went to No. 3 on the Hot 100. “This time we chose not to bite our tongues,” Bivins told [SPIN] in 1990. “This is us, we’re just speaking words that we hear every day.”
The obscenity trial surrounding 2 Live Crew had reframed hip-hop’s explicit sexuality as a free speech issue. If BBD wanted to be “mentally hip-hop,” they had to find some way to align themselves with hip-hop’s confrontational cool. And as three former teen heartthrobs who had grown up singing love songs, making the leap to sex songs was the most believable way for them court controversy.
The music video for another hit, “She’s Dope!,” where they compare the object of their affection to a “sexy X-rated video queen,” features a scene where Bell pours a bottle of champagne on a woman’s breasts. Selling sex was BBD’s way of asserting their masculinity, and, as is often the case, women were caught in the crossfire. “Poison” might be a transcendent party song, but its low-point is DeVoe’s mean-spirited, hypocritical assessment of a woman who’s slept around:
The low-pro ho, she’ll be cut like an afro
So what cha sayin’, huh?
She’s a winner to you
But I know she’s a loser
How do you know?
Me and the crew used to do her
BBD not only gave R&B singers permission to talk like rappers, they proved that baggy pants, dope beats, and a little casual misogyny could turn you into a huge crossover pop star. At the time, R&B needed to break free from the stale love-song conventions, but we now live in a world where Chris Brown has everyone singing “these hoes ain’t loyal” at the Soul Train Awards. Hip-hop contains multitudes, and Bell Biv DeVoe chose not to co-opt rap’s Afrocentric identity politics, its clever multi-layered lyricism, or its criticism of systemic racism. The fact that they mostly chose to co-opt hip-hop’s misogyny—and the fact that it made them even more famous—shows what entertains us as a culture.
Ralph Tresvant still did not understand BBD’s crossover appeal. “That’s weird to me, man. We’re all from New Edition. White folks eat up Bell Biv DeVoe, but [when] we’re together, they scratch their heads,” he said in the wake of their success. Along with Tone Loc, Young MC, and MC Hammer, BBD helped usher hip-hop into mainstream radio rotation, clearing the way for white-privilege beneficiary Vanilla Ice to score the first No. 1 rap hit in the fall of 1990. And like hair metal’s death at the hands of grunge, hip-hop’s rise rendered many veteran R&B acts irrelevant—especially those who weren’t capable of adopting the sound and style of rap.
Bell Biv DeVoe weren’t the first to inject hip-hop into R&B. But they were the first to suggest that the two genres could be one in the same, predicting the rise of modern genre-fluid hip-hop/R&B superstars like Missy Elliot, Black Eyed Peas, and Drake. BBD’s slogan—mentally hip-hop, smoothed-out on the R&B tip with a pop feel appeal—sounded crazy in 1990, but today, it sounds like a prophecy.",2018-07-29T05:00:00,['Pop/R&B'],7.4,MCA,Bell Biv Devoe: Poison Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bell-biv-devoe-poison/,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018-07-29,6.823287671232877,2018.5,0.0
59,Behind the Green Door EP,['Laurel Halo'],"Less than a year since Laurel Halo released her debut full-length for Hyperdub, she returns with a four-track EP for the label. If Quarantine resembled an amalgam of flesh and machine, here Halo goes one step closer to erasing humanity from the frame by including none of her trademark vocal swoops.
It's less than a year since Laurel Halo released her debut full-length album for Hyperdub, the brittle, beautiful Quarantine. This four-track EP for the same label makes that record feel light-years away. The vocals are gone, the sense of space has all but vanished. If Quarantine resembled a Cronenbergian amalgam of flesh and machine, here Halo goes one step closer to erasing humanity from the frame. Those swooping vocal takes feel absent at first. It's hard not to mourn their removal, and worry about the premature halting of an idea that had long life in it yet. On further plays, though, Behind the Green Door casts a different shadow over Quarantine, just as that album did with her prior work. It makes Quarantine a stronger, bolder piece, gaining a little extra weight due to the sense of isolation, even among Halo's own work, that surrounds it.
The sense of forward momentum merges into the music on Behind the Green Door in a quite literal sense; these aren't exactly club bangers, but the feeling of propulsion is aided by the beats that underpin all four tracks. Those rhythms guide Halo down a purposefully tangled path, picking up elements of house music and minimal techno along the way, but cloaking them in a sense of agitation that's barely kept below surface level. This isn't exactly angry music, but there is a feeling of itchy unease that runs as a theme throughout. ""NOYFB"" is the best embodiment of this, with each new layer feeling slightly out of step with everything that came immediately prior. It's disorienting, which is, it seems, Halo's favorite place to be, allowing her to construct worlds that immediately get pulled down and discarded on the cutting room floor. She never appears fully satisfied in the present moment, always eager to move on somewhere else.
Halo has commented on the ""sexual energy"" of these tracks, setting up a fascinating disparity between the title of the EP (taken from a well-known porn film from the 1970s, which was among the first hardcore pictures to gain wide distribution) and the tender pound that thumps through a track like ""Sex Mission"". If there is a sexual energy, it's wide-ranging, bridging from moments of quiet joy and reflection to feelings of loneliness and alienation. But the sense of distance being gained while human aspects recede, at least compared to what came before on Quarantine, adds a further twist. The bass drum beats and bursts of stiff electronics that rise in ""UHFFO"" suggest a darker sensuality, something more akin to the dystopian sci-fi dreams of Demon Seed, the 70s horror feature in which Julie Christie is impregnated by a supercomputer. The underlying themes of that film-- of technology being abused, breaking down, fudging the lines between what's real and artificial-- serve as a useful parallel to the feel of Behind the Green Door.
It's interesting to listen back to Hour Logic, Halo's 2011 EP for Hippos in Tanks, in light of the moves she's made here. In many ways the two releases feel like the flipside of a utopian dream, with the earlier work all brash outward moves, caught up in a moment of cautious optimism. ""Throw"" from this EP is noticeably harder, more pessimistic in outlook, with the warped, house-y piano stabs the perfect dysfunctional hook to signal a sense of restlessness. There's a feeling of moving away from something, not to a space necessarily much darker than some of Quarantine, but certainly one where chaos and decline are taking a stronger hold. The title of the EP makes more sense in that context, if you take the enormous popularity of Behind the Green Door as a sort of ground zero for the subsequent wave of seedy profiteering that the adult film industry would be built upon. This work feels more in tune with decay and exploitation in sexual portrayal, the numbness accrued from a constant barrage of imagery, than anything that’s notionally ""sexy.""",2013-05-21T06:00:01,['Electronic'],7.2,Hyperdub,Laurel Halo: Behind the Green Door EP Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18051-laurel-halo-behind-the-green-door-ep/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2013-05-21,1.6315068493150684,2013.25,0.0
60,Driver,['Adult Mom'],"Stevie Knipe’s third LP builds layered arrangements and a renewed sense of confidence without sacrificing the earnest, confessional vulnerability of their songwriting.
To drive is to be in control while accepting there is nothing you can control. On Adult Mom’s Driver, self-doubt almost sends Stevie Knipe spinning out in the aftermath of a breakup. But with wry, intimate lyrics and jangly electric guitar, they wrest back control to celebrate small, precious triumphs amid the trauma of everyday life. The effect is both cathartic and dazzling, like the high you feel on your way out of a really good therapy session.
Knipe writes lyrics so honest they border on awkward, capturing the often embarrassing everyday minutiae of depression and soul-crushing capitalism. “I am isolating, I get my communication/From an overdue hospital bill,” they sing softly on “Breathing,” over phased synthesizer and Olivia Battell’s staccato drum beat, before Allegra Eidinger’s guitar interrupts and Knipe calls up a wistful soprano that brings to mind Imogen Heap’s “Goodnight and Go.” Their revealing lyrics establish trust: They’re not trying to come off as anything but totally honest.
A knack for storytelling that feels real, even when it’s unflattering, is the cornerstone of Adult Mom’s music. If their first album, 2015’s Momentary Lapse of Happily, was intimate as a dorm-room performance, Driver feels bigger, like it’s performed from a stage. Knipes uses the emotional force of their suffering to propel expansive, layered arrangements that make room for head-bobbing melodies, chilly synths, and guitar solos. Even “Passenger,” a cozy, melancholy ballad whose guitar strums and close harmonies recall First Aid Kit, has a sense of urgency.
Regaining control is rarely a linear path; it comes with ugly setbacks, which Knipe articulates with the cathartic levity of the dog who says “this is fine.” That levity is perhaps best exemplified in the surfy daze of “Dancing”: “I’m dancing to/The song I crashed my car to,” they sing, a Russian doll of a lyric that opens to reveal trauma within triumph, joy within tragedy. “Sober” addresses an ex-lover with trademark candor: “The only thing that I’ve done/This month is drink beer and masturbate, and ignore phone calls from you/What else am I supposed to do.” A jaunty drum-machine beat and minimal keys provide a canvas for Knipe’s clear vocals, which glide easily from speaking to singing, giving the song a confessional quality. It ends with a victory that hits like a punchline: “Now I don’t even think of you when I am sober.”
“Adam” notches another victory: making it to the other side of anxieties around queerness. On “Told Ya So,” from Momentary Lapse of Happily, Knipe sounded more tentative, setting lyrics about shame and self-acceptance to understated rhythm guitar. On “Adam,” they turn the dial up, punctuating the song with juicy, Guitar Hero-worthy riffs. “I see the girl I want to kiss/But I’m not sure if she wants to kiss/But at least I can ask without feeling like shit,” they sing, with a nervousness and excitement that seemingly allows them to fit 30 syllables into one breath.
Regaining agency amid heartbreak, depression, and loneliness is often messy, and just when it feels like you’re finally on your way, you trip and fall. But coming back to yourself doesn’t have to mean remaking your whole life; healing happens both in celebrating the triumphs—like asking the girl if she wants to kiss, or not drinking the beer—and in cataloguing the messiness. Driver succeeds because Knipe is able to do both.

61,Tropicalbacanal,['Bonde Do Rolê'],"Confounding expectations, the Brazilian club brats' second album proper is an ambitious collection that expands their range-- including hook-ups with Caetano Veloso and Das Racist-- without sacrificing any of the mindless fun that made them such a lark the first time around.
It was easy to assume Brazilian club brats Bonde Do Rolê would never make it to a second album. Their first, 2007's With Lasers, was everything you'd probably want out of a drunken party. Innocently horny. Up for anything. Vaguely illicit but basically non-threatening. Fueled by loud, dumb, grungy beats, as if art-school punks had suddenly fixed on hip-house as the way forward circa 1989. And over before everything got stale, ugly, and embarrassing.
Unsubtle would be an understatement, and it certainly wasn't for every occasion. But if you needed to disengage your thinking brain and rock out to pomp-metal riffs, With Lasers was there for you that summer. It didn't leave Bonde many places to go, though. Who wanted to hear these sexed-up goofs grappling with aging and ambition? Their music was about unashamed crude enthusiasm, which generally promises a few killer singles rather than a multi-album career.
Stranger and cruder acts than Bonde have matured in interesting ways, though. Five years have passed since With Lasers, and a total sonic overhaul would be necessary to make Tropicalbacanal anything other than nostalgia for grubby bacchanals gone by. Which, luckily, is what we get, and it's a very good thing-- expanding Bonde's range in a major way without totally losing the head banging and hip thrusting that give them purpose. Dervish frontwoman Marina Ribatski is out, replaced by singer Laura Taylor, who the other Bondes found via open auditions in Brazil. In theory, Marina's absence should strip a lot of the personality from Bonde's music. In actuality, not so much. As a live presence, Marina had moxie to spare. On record, she couldn't quite get that on-stage intensity across all the time. The chirpy Taylor has enough moxie of her own, and Bonde wisely drafted in a few ringers to add some global color. And global color is what this album is all about.
Musically, Tropicalbacanal is bright as neon paint splashed against white walls, with hooks that make it as mindlessly enjoyable as a daylong piña colada session on one of those indie rock booze cruises. It's party music, pure and simple. The expiration date for this album is still sometime around when the weather gets cold. But it's also adventurous and audacious and assured, an album you may actually pull out next summer, a big leap from a band many had probably written off. It's beach music made by people who've grown up with ""beach music"" as a cultural heritage, but who don't feel the need to keep that heritage pure.
Grappling with their country's musical history doesn't exactly mean these kids have transmogrified into Milton Nascimento overnight, but it does mean they have certain standards to live up to. Brazilian don Caetano Veloso shows up at one point, and it says something that he fits neatly into the mix, rather than shaming the Bondes with an offhand display of old-dude skillfulness. And it probably helps that Brazil's vintage beach music is so melodically dense and polyrhythmically colorful. You can't just strum a few lazy surf chords, affect a Brian Wilson vocal, and call it a day. ""Puco"" barrels along, feeling loose and airy, even as it tries to pack as much detail into 2:15 as possible: multiple zigzagging lines of rhythm, guitars zinging across the beat, whistling, stuff that sounds like whistling but might be flutes, call-and-response vocals, something approximating a song. It's a tightly wound sound that requires work to feel so playful.
Bonde's rap influence is downplayed in general across Tropicalbacanal. We get it in brief but potent bursts, and it helps that the guest rappers can actually rap, unlike the charming but goony cargo-cult approximation Bonde were peddling before. The delirious horndogging of ""Brazilian Boys"" comes off fierce rather than silly, thanks to moonlighting Jamaican MC Ce'Cile's no-bullshit performance, and Das Racist's Kool A.D. sounds tighter than he has in a while on his brief cameo in ""Bang"". The beats are far more varied than the eventually deadening baile funk stomp that ruled With Lasers. ""Kanye"" starts as an inexplicable mash of accordion, sampled chicken squawks, and robotically processed singing, only to explode into a head-banging soca track, the accordion still oompah-ing along at punk rock speed. And if some songs initially sound like paint-by-numbers Tropicália, there's usually a modern rhythmic idea banging around the corner.
This is also very much a guitar record, one that goes in far weirder, wilder directions than the cheesy butt-rock bites on Bonde's first album. Despite that aforementioned verse from Kool A.D., ""Bang"" actually sounds more like radio-ready garage rock, building not to a fuzz freakout but something like a Yosemite Sam gunfight in a Looney Tunes short. Distant kin to the Modern Lovers' ""Egyptian Reggae"", ""Kilo"" is a slice of catchy ethnic fakery, first wave rock'n'roll as imagined by an isolated garage band somewhere in Southeast Asia. And then re-imagined by a bunch of cheeky Brazilian kids who grew up with dancehall on their iPods. That cultural jumbling was always what Bonde was about, mixing hip-house with Alice in Chains, but they've never been as go-for-broke about it as they are here, or cast so widely in search of hooks.
Tropicalbacanal is not a reverent retro record by any means, though it voraciously eats up influences from across the globe, and from throughout pop history. If it looks back to Brazilian classics from the 60s and 70s, it also mutates them via 21st-century sounds, and pumps them full of a lot of perverse personality. But only in flashes does it sound like the Bonde you know. Maybe it's a good thing if you come to this record with no preconceptions, because it often feels like the work of a new band looking to prove itself, and pulling it off.",2012-08-03T06:00:04,['Pop/R&B'],6.0,Mad Decent,Bonde Do Rolê: Tropicalbacanal Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16761-tropicalbacanal/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2012-08-03,0.8342465753424657,2012.5,0.0
62,Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll,['Neil Michael Hagerty'],"When I heard about the Royal Trux split-up last year, I figured it had to be a joke. Something about ...
When I heard about the Royal Trux split-up last year, I figured it had to be a joke. Something about the Hagerty/Herrema combo seemed so right and inevitable; the idea that indie rock's Adam & Eve had gone their separate ways was something I just couldn't process. I figured Neil would use the press surrounding the split as a little free publicity for his debut album, and before you knew it the jig would be up and Royal Trux would be back on the rails.
Well, if the break-up was a joke, it's a media prank of Kaufman-esque proportions, because here we are nine months later, with another Hagerty solo album and still not a peep out of Herrema. What's she up to? Neil himself says he has no idea, but he's stayed busy with songwriting and has gone back to collaborating. So, in a way, it's sad that Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll ends up the sound of Hagerty forming a rock band and getting on with his life. As such, we get a full-band effort featuring two drummers, a sax player, and a handful of strings, instead of the first album's lonely, home-recorded homage to classic rock.
Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll has some new textural twists for Hagerty, but one thing hasn't changed: he's pulled the loaded six-string from his back and is soloing his ass off. Only a precious few tracks sneak by without him lurching into a feedback-drenched ode to axe-slingers past, and how you feel about that probably depends on whether or not you play guitar yourself. Quite honestly, the only way a track like ""The Storm Sons"" (with its pitiful ""only god can rescue me, only god can make a tree"" couplet repeated endlessly) could have lasting appeal is as an instructional tape. Hagerty's lines are distinctive and weird, with an intriguing internal logic. But with a few exceptions, I'm not somebody who can listen to balls-to-the-wall guitar soloing for minutes on end. Caveat emptor on the fretwork.
Of the nine tracks on this brief record, four seem nothing more than noisy excuses for Hagerty's solos. What's frustrating is that the remainder are solid, and two are even great. ""Gratitude"" is a shuffling blues/rock number with a killer rhythm hook and minimal lyrics (basically ""thanks a lot"" said a few different ways) that manages to stay in your head despite its surface-level banality. The obligatory acid-fried guitar solo here works well because of its brevity. Also great is ""Oklahoma Township,"" with its 60s R&B; vocal feel and a clever integration of violin that reminds me of Alejandro Escovedo. The guitar solo on ""Oklahoma Township"" very nearly spirals out of control, but Hagerty reels it in and sings alongside it in parallel, nicely redeeming it. The violin makes another appearance on ""Some People Are Crazy,"" elevating what is essentially an excellent late-60s Stones ballad with Hagerty on acoustic and a disciplined vocal. And both ""It Could Happen Again"" and ""Rockslide,"" both of which sound like lost Woody Guthrie songs performed by a garage rock band, are instantly memorable.
So that's two great songs, three pretty good ones, and four stinkers. Hagerty's always been a little erratic, but that's still not a good ratio. One excellent album could have been salvaged from the two he's released in the last year, probably, but in these post-Royal Trux days, we have to take what we can get or move on. I'm edging closer to the latter, myself.",2002-04-04T06:00:02,['Rock'],5.2,Drag City,Neil Michael Hagerty: Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3701-plays-that-good-old-rock-and-roll/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2002-04-04,-9.505479452054795,2002.25,0.0
63,TO LOVE IS TO LIVE,['Jehnny Beth'],"With livewire intensity, the Savages singer-songwriter’s ambitious and experimental solo album explodes with life from every corner as an epic display of contrasting themes and emotion. 
Jehnny Beth didn’t set out to write love songs. In 2011, as the French singer born Camille Berthomier began to write a debut album with her new punk band, Savages, she swore off the subject, finding topics like identity and censorship more fruitful. But when it came time for Savages’ second record, a switch had flipped. Overwhelmed by the generosity and warmth radiating from her audience, Beth wanted to bounce some of it back. That impulse yielded 2016’s Adore Life, an album whose slash-and-burn guitar work lit up the tenderness of its lyrics.
TO LOVE IS TO LIVE, Beth’s new solo album—written and produced with Savages producer (and Beth’s longtime partner) Johnny Hostile—is not a Savages record by another name. Beth sidelines the grimy, distorted guitar and reaches for a more diverse palette, including strobe-like synths, downy woodwinds, and inscrutable snippets of found sound. But there are constants: TO LOVE IS TO LIVE is rife with the same livewire intensity, the same embrace of tensions and apparent contradictions. Lyrically and musically, it vacillates between the corporeal and the ethereal, prudence and excess, softness and severity. Its various parts could fill out the whole character alignment grid from lawful good to chaotic evil. If not always love, they demonstrate fascination with the full spectrum of human experience and beyond.
Presenting herself as an alien (or a sentient robot?), Beth opens the record with a sweeping, spoken-word poem warped by vocal filters. Elsewhere, she’s an all-too-human lover, longing for closeness. On “I’m the Man,” she’s an aggressor, spitting the titular phrase more than 30 times through an audible snarl. She is pious and a miscreant, sometimes at once. Beth appears as a statue on the record’s cover, her powerful stance and icy glare locked in stone; under the surface, though, things are far more fluid.
This has structural implications, too: TO LOVE IS TO LIVE is stuffed with disorienting interludes, codas, and about-faces. On more than one occasion, Beth and her collaborators build up a hardcore frenzy, then swiftly pull out the rug: The seething chaos of “How Could You” abruptly tumbles into ambient birdsong. Instrumental lines are collaged together with skittering synthetics; Beth’s alto is distinctive but mutable, and she flits between acridity and softness. There is some organizing logic across the album, like the reprisal of the opening poem on its final track, signaling the completion of a cycle. But, on the whole, it is indifferent to order.
Rather, urgency emerges as its guiding principle, heard in its dramatic crescendos and emphatic percussion. Beth’s idea for a solo project germinated in 2016, following the death of David Bowie. After revisiting his final album, Blackstar, she was overtaken by an existentialist conviction that man (or woman) is nothing but his or her own making. Beth wanted to create something to cement her own legacy—an undeniably daunting task. “I couldn’t shake the feeling of my mortality, all through doing it,” she recently said, of working on the album. “I felt it was important that I do this before I died.” The sense that the clock is ticking hangs in the air. On opener “I Am,” a timer pulses as if Beth is on deadline to transfer her thoughts onto tape. There’s no room for tidiness under such conditions.
Pondering death raises matters of conscience (particularly for someone like Beth, who is, as she notes on “Innocence,” plagued by Catholic guilt). And so sin—both of the flesh and of society at large—emerges as a motif. Near the midway point, Beth enlists actor Cillian Murphy to bemoan the cruelties of war and capitalism in a piercing reading of her poem “A Place Above.” Beth said that “I’m the Man,” which follows, is not an excoriation of the patriarchy, but an exploration of the destructive tendencies that live within all of us. It’s difficult, though, to write off the song’s blatantly misogynistic language (“There’s no bitch in town/Who doesn’t understand/How hard my dick can be”) entirely; in this self-interrogation, Beth takes toxic masculinity as a given, a baseline against which she can measure her own inner demons.
But Beth’s lyrics are often more evocative than they are precisely descriptive or narrative. And for all her fixation on virtue and sin, she’s not out to moralize, exactly, but rather to capture all the messiness, contradiction, and even ugliness of life. This is true even of album closer “Human,” on which she refutes her humanity altogether and surrenders her body to the cloud: “I used to be a human being/Now I live in the web.” Scientists say that whole brain emulation—actually uploading our minds—is still a distant prospect, for reasons both technological and ethical. Until then, we’re left with more analog methods of cataloging our lives and shoring up our legacies. As any artist knows, this is an imperfect, imprecise project—but that’s the beauty of it.

64,I Am > I Was,['21 Savage'],"The second album from one of Atlanta’s most promising rappers recasts him as a star in waiting. He writes with grisly clarity and humor, and his songs here are sturdy, inventive, and sticky.
The jarringly sober track “a lot,” which opens 21 Savage’s poised and superbly focused i am > i was, is contemplative without being dramatic, mournful but not morose. At one point, the 26-year-old recounts his little brother’s murder and how it warped his psychology, but he does so in a perfunctory way, like talking to a therapist who’s already familiar with the smaller details. It’s a great tone to strike first: moody at a bit of a remove.
Early in his career, the Atlanta rapper appeared almost exclusively as a mood—his voice was the ideally dry vehicle for 2016’s Savage Mode, Metro Boomin’s experiment in tempo and ambient sound. At times, 21’s appeal was explained away as a sort of authenticity fetishism, as if the raw carnage in the music was the main selling point. In truth, he’s spent the last few years building a persona that’s tormented by trauma and violence but unworried about projecting just how tough or wise or beloved or feared it’s made him. His raps are self-assured. The songs about the strip club—like the Three 6-sampling, Yung Miami-featuring “a&t”—are good because they’re good strip club songs not because they’re couched in self-awareness or PTSD.
21 is an effective writer because he’s not hung up on what everything means—he’s much more interested in how things actually are, how they feel: the pit in his stomach when he thinks about jail, the weight of his jewelry in his hand. He’s tormented but also wants to go to the club, loves his mom but also his bodyguards, and is willing to explore those halves of himself without using “whoa, there are two halves of me” as a narrative crutch. So the statement in the title—I am greater than I was—is a little misleading. This is not a record about self-improvement as a 12-step course with dramatic results. When it’s about anything, it’s about self-improvement as a small, constant struggle where you contradict yourself and eat your own tail.
The way 21 describes the grisliest details of his past can be unnerving when he filters it through an unexpected tone. He’ll rap about gruesome memories that are shocking in their neutrality: “Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on/Shit on my wrist? I woulda killed the whole house for.” 21 has burrowed so deep into his trauma-wracked brain (see “Close My Eyes” or “Numb” from 2017’s Issa Album) that the subtlest modulations on how he speaks about his demons can have a profound effect. On “asmr,” he raps, “All these dead bodies got me seein’ strange things” with a bounce in his voice that makes it seem like he’s about to introduce a new dance, and maybe he is.
Those small tweaks are smart, but they have nothing on the spontaneous adjustments to his voice. Before Savage Mode, 21 had never been locked to such a deep register and quite so laconic a flow. Since he’s been famous, he’s perfected a half-dozen variations on his whispered style, finding a whole dynamic range where a lesser vocalist would come off as painfully one-note. (Think of 21 as Meek Mill’s equal opposite: The number of textures and variations Meek brings to his full-throttle bars are the same ones 21 brings to his sotto voce raps.) 21’s found a way to emote without breaking character, to grin at the camera without letting his voice crack and sound sarcastic. This helps him sell the sly jokes he peppers throughout: On “can’t leave without it” alone, he says he keeps a stick “like a hobo” and brags about his gun being autographed by Osama Bin Laden.
There are points where i am > i was nearly becomes rote; “break da law,” the Offset duet “1.5,” and parts of other songs will sink into production formats that are so well-worn they’ve become ruts; a song like “gun smoke” is little more than 21 on autopilot. Those blips are fine considering that most of the record is musically exciting. The groove on “letter 2 my momma” is irresistible, and “good day”—which samples Lord Infamous’ “Damn I’m Crazed,” a song 21 could have written in another life—makes superb use of both Project Pat and Schoolboy Q’s voice. There’s also “all my friends,” which is really a showcase for Post Malone, as if it could follow “rockstar” straight to the top of the charts.
i am > i was shatters the notion of 21 Savage as a specialist with a narrow purview and audience, and recasts him as a star in waiting, all without forcing him into unflattering contortions. It also cements him as a far more original stylist than other hopefuls from Atlanta, like Lil Baby and Gunna, who appear here together and sound simply like Young Thug disciples. At its best, the album is still weird, like when 21 raps earnestly over Santana, or when he ends with a Young Nudy duet that sounds for all the world like the third act of a Morricone western. That’s the song where 21 sneers at rappers who “drop a mixtape, then they tattoo their face.” It gets at the core idea of his work: You can’t fool people into thinking you’re someone you’re not.",2019-01-02T06:00:00,['Rap'],7.8,Slaughter Gang,21 Savage: I Am > I Was Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21-savage-i-am-i-was/,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2019-01-02,7.2534246575342465,2019.0,0.0
65,“ring spiel” tour ’95,['Mike Watt'],"This live album captures one night in the unlikely, alt-rock-superstar-laden tour behind Minutemen legend Mike Watt's first solo album, featuring Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and more.
“ring spiel” tour ’95 captures one night in a superstar tour that assembled in support of the legendary Mike Watt’s  first solo album, Ball-Hog or Tugboat?  The former-Minutemen bass player turned fIREHOSE band leader gathered an insane and unlikely roster of alternative-rock superstars to not only support his album, but follow him on tour. Evan Dando, Kathleen Hanna, Ad-Rock and Mike D, Eddie Vedder, the Kirkwood brothers, Dave Pirner, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, J Mascis, Nels Cline, half of Sonic Youth, and Mark Lanegan— these are just a few of the names in the long, long credits list. The title of the live record, recorded at the Metro in Chicago on May 6, 1995, references Watt’s concept of Ball-Hog or Tugboat? as being a wrestling match, where each group of musicians “got in the ring” with Watt.
The touring band for “ring spiel” would end up being Grohl, Vedder, Pat Smear, and William Goldsmith, freshly ex-Sunny Day Real Estate and newly christened Foo Fighter. Opening were Hovercraft, the multi-media project helmed by Beth Liebling (whose husband happened to be Vedder) and the then-fledgling Foo Fighters. The tour was run according to Watt’s ‘we jam econo’ ethos from back in the Minutemen days; there were no fancy tour buses, no blacked-out windows; everyone was in a van, driving themselves to gigs, 31 shows in 42 days, the kind of thing that Watt could do in his sleep. The kids, although they were more famous, needed to keep up.
The tickets were sold as a Mike Watt show, and as the liner notes (written by Michael Azerrad) point out, promoters were under strict instructions to not use Grohl or Vedder to promote the tour. But the jig was up, not because of local promoters trying to sell tickets, but because of fan networks on the internet. The Nirvana, Pearl Jam and even Foo Fighters fan bases were already well-entrenched, and word travelled fast, via Usenet and BBS and listserv. Then MTV showed up to a gig and poked their nose around, and any pretense of subterfuge was gone. Vedder could wear a floppy hat and drum in back of Hovercraft’s video projections all he wanted to, but the remaining shows, all in theaters and clubs, far below Pearl Jam or Nirvana capacities, sold out quickly. This was undoubtedly bittersweet: on the one hand, getting Watt in front of a larger audience was surely part of the point of the parade of stars on the record; on the other, the star power's ability to hang back in the shadows was gone, the Halloween costume (in the case of Vedder, a wig) removed.
But the newfound attention didn’t distract the band from the task at hand: the show. “ring spiel” tour ’95 catches the band about halfway through the outing, and they’re tight and cohesive: for all of the econo ethic of the tour, it’s their hard-earned experience of the musicians that makes them tremendous. As a concert package, it was a great lineup: Hovercraft’s psychedelic shimmer as an amuse-bouche, followed by the explosive energy of the early Foo Fighters, and then the journeyman punk rock stylings of Mr. Watt and his group. The set, as represented here on the live album, was constructed from eight of the 17 songs on the record, along with well-chosen covers of songs by the Minutemen, fIREHOSE, Madonna, Blue Oyster Cult, Daniel Johnston, and others.
The 16-song set veers around punk and country and country-punk, as well as flat-out pop (“Piss-Bottle Man,” improbably enough), and it’s tight and well-sequenced and varied in texture, just like a package-tour set needs to be. Watt had fIREHOSE fans and his credentials from his days in Minutemen were unquestionable, but you don’t assemble a roster of high-powered guests for your record to fade into oblivion. Hopefully, a kid who liked the Lemonheads or the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or never got to see Nirvana would come check out the album or the tour, and become a fan of Mike Watt. Or so that was the thought.
The songs from Ball-Hog… absolutely hold their own against the rest of the material. “Forever...One Reporter’s Opinion” maintains the urgency of the Minutemen original, Pat Smear on lead vocals sounding like he wrote it himself. “Chinese Firedrill” pulls straight from the Flying Burrito heart of California folk rock with no irony. “E-Ticket Ride” has a jazz-like energy, with both Grohl and Goldsmith on drums, complementing each other seamlessly as though they’d been playing together forever.
“Against the ’70s” would end up being the most well-known song from the record, because it was a duet with the then-reclusive Eddie Vedder. Later in the set, Vedder has a solo turn where he breaks out what would become a new Pearl Jam song: “Habit” would see the light of day on 1996’s No Code. Stripped down to essentials and anchored by Watt’s fat, fluid notes, “Habit” feels like it belongs here as much as anything else in the set.
The encores are fun: “The Red and the Black” by Blue Oyster Cult, who were kissing cousins on the edge of punk, and an old Watt/Minutemen love, becomes a pneumatic drill when in the hands of these guys, with Grohl taking lead guitar. But the real esoteric number is the Madonna cover, a Ciccone Youth special interpretation of “Secret Garden” from Erotica, sung with love and camp by Pat Smear, powered only by Watt and Goldsmith, not that far away from the original arrangement.
At their best, live albums capture not just a concert performance, but also document the energy and the context around the music. “ring spiel” tour ’95 manages to accomplish all of the above; it’s a nice time capsule if you were there, and it’s a great document to have if you weren’t, commemorating early years of musicians who are now canonic. At one point, Watt admonishes what were undoubtedly a disproportionate amount of amateur crowd-surfers: “Do you like those people rolling all over your heads?” (The crowd responds with a unanimous “No.”) “Then why don’t we give it a rest. Have to have your old man come up here and act like a fucking cop, to tell you that shit,” Watt says, the disgust obvious in his voice. If nothing else, this tour is a tribute to his instincts as a band leader, and a scene elder. He might have had some trepidation on starting over after ending fIREHOSE, but this record proves that he never should have doubted his instincts onstage.",2016-11-22T06:00:00,['Rock'],8.0,Legacy,Mike Watt: “ring spiel” tour ’95 Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22565-ring-spiel-tour-95/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2016-11-22,5.141095890410959,2016.75,0.0
66,Silence,['Monolake'],"Blending techno, dubstep, and ambient into an hour of idiosyncratic drift, this is programmed electronic music at its most sensually expressive.
Every high-end audio equipment showroom ought to have a few Monolake CDs on hand. Just as vendors of big-screen HD televisions bank images that bristle with detail-- rustling fields of crimson poppies, sparkling seascapes-- sellers of hi-fi systems could use Monolake's sub-bass throb and pin-prick highs to show off their painstakingly engineered products. The Berlin musician's work has always been attuned to shiveringly precise sonics, but Silence represents a new pinnacle of sound as full-spectrum embrace. (Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Monolake's production notes emphasize that the album was recorded and mastered without compression, making this a welcome counter-offensive in the ""loudness wars."") That's not to say that this is merely music for hi-fi nerds. Blending elements of techno, dubstep, and ambient into an hour of suggestive, idiosyncratic drift, Silence presents programmed electronic music at its most sensually expressive.
Monolake knows his way around sound design, of course. Also known as Robert Henke, he was one of the original developers of Ableton Live, the popular performance and production software, making him not only something of a legend, but also a rarity: very few figures have achieved a similar degree of success in both recording and instrument design. To give you an idea of his impact, imagine a latter-day Robert Moog or Tom Oberheim, but with a discography as deep as his list of patents. (Monolake is actually a shifting, collaborative project; it began as a duo of Henke and fellow Ableton co-founder Gerhard Behles, who later left the group; since the mid-2000s, Monolake has occasionally comprised Henke and Torsten Pröfrock, aka T++. Silence, however, is credited as a solo Henke production.)
Ableton Live takes a fair amount of flak on producers' forums for delivering sound quality allegedly inferior to that of Logic Pro-- a claim that I've never seen substantiated. In any case, Silence, which was composed, edited, and mixed entirely in Live, offers ample evidence to the contrary. I can't think of a single piece of contemporary electronic music that sounds fuller, richer, or more nuanced. But this also isn't ""pure"" computer music; according to Henke's production notes, along with its synthesized sounds the album incorporates a wide range of real-world sonics-- metal percussion, dripping water, architectural acoustics, and all manner of field recordings-- that place it in a long tradition of musique concrète. This isn't an academic distinction; it's that openness to the world of sound that gives Silence such immersive depth.
Crucial to the success of the album is the way that Henke blurs the line between the sampled and the synthetic. One of the album's central elements is a recurring sound like mallets bouncing on metal cable-- whether it's ""real"" or ""artificial"" I don't know, or care-- whose fluid, regular/irregular bounce lends a delicious gravity. They might be the record's most radical achievement, counterbalancing techno's rigidity with rippling, quicksilver grace. In essence, these patterns translate Henke's interest in granular sound to the realm of rhythm: over and over, textures become patterns and vice versa. Silence is a masterful exploration of the vagaries of scale, one that-- quite unlike your HD plasma screen-- rewards equally whether witnessed close up, far away, or deep inside.",2010-01-22T06:00:04,['Electronic'],7.8,Imbalance Computer Music,Monolake: Silence Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13855-silence/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2010-01-22,-1.6972602739726028,2010.0,0.0
67,Operation: Doomsday,['MF DOOM'],"Best new reissue
This instant cult classic returns in a lavish deluxe edition complete with bonus material, commemorative playing cards, and yes, a lunchbox.
Whether a classic archetype like Superman or a self-fashioned alter ego like Bobby Digital, embodying a comic-book figure holds a large appeal in hip-hop, an art form driven by mythology and boasting of superhuman capability. But Daniel Dumile might be the only rapper who based his persona on a supervillain whose origin story sounds uncannily like his own. To recap: While a promising student at Empire State University, Fantastic Four nemesis Victor Von Doom conducted experiments attempting to communicate with the dead, and a resulting explosion completely deformed his face. After roaming the world and studying under monks in Tibet, he built a suit of armor with a matching mask to protect him as he sought the destruction of those at fault for his disfigurement.
Meanwhile, Dumile, then known as Zev Love X in early-90s rap group K.M.D., suffered the loss of his brother and musical partner DJ Subroc, who was hit by a car. That same week, K.M.D. were dropped from their label when the cover art of their Black Bastards LP proved controversial. Retreating from hip-hop completely, Dumile plotted his revenge on an industry that had broken him spiritually. This meant performing in lyricist lounges with his face completely obscured; all the while, his legend grew as bootleg copies of Black Bastards make the rounds. Then, in 1999, after the release of a couple of singles on Bobbito's Fondle 'Em Records, came Operation: Doomsday, an instant cult classic that now gets a well-curated and altogether fun reissue courtesy of MF Doom's own Metal Face label.
Doomsday was birthed at a pivotal point in rap's trajectory-- at the height of the record industry's boom years. Bad Boy's commercial reign was giving purists plenty to carp over, but it still had crate-digging production and New York rappers in its midst. But soon after, rawer collectives like Ruff Ryders and Ca$h Money subsequently took hip-hop to a more hedonistic, nihilistic, and violent place, with Swizz Beatz, Mannie Fresh, the Neptunes, and Timbaland commandeering a clean break from traditionalist, sample-based production. This opened a lane for underground crews who often defined themselves in opposition of these artists: Anticon and Def Jux sought to completely dismantle hip-hop with abrasive sonics and intimidatingly dense lyrics, while Rawkus and Okayplayer had the magnetic personalities and smooth musicianship to be inside operatives potentially bringing mainstream rap to a more positive place.
On the title track, Doom announces his intent instead to ""destroy rap."" Operation: Doomsday doesn't sound like much of a manifesto, though: You may have come for the street cred, but you didn't stay for any hang-ups about authenticity or the state of the genre. That's mostly due to the sonic template established here, chunky and proudly un-quantized drums meeting samples you might hear at your dentist's office or on hold with your cable company: saxes, flutes, and smooth, vintage synths. While the autumnal, twinkling backdrops of ""Doomsday"" or the Coral Sitar-laced ""Red and Gold"" wouldn't upset tables at your local coffee shop, they provide a truly symbiotic relationship with the paradoxically gruff and calm persona Doom manifests here, where the villainy is more implied than anything.
In fact, for an album that introduced the Metal Face alter ego, it's his warmest and most benevolent work, almost entirely bled of the angrier material that would mark future releases. If anything, Doom is still in mourning here, and there's a palpable sense of loss that rears itself sporadically: Doom imagines rejoining his brother in a tomb ""either unmarked or engraved"" and holds a seance with Subroc on ""?"". For an MC not associated with emotional bloodletting, this record has some astounding moments.
If you're familiar only with Doom's post-Madvillainy work, it might be a jolt to hear just how lighthearted this sounds otherwise: Doom sounds surprisingly young, with a sprightly bounce to his muddy rush of words, and the song structures are among his most traditional. Whether it's the entire-verse hook of ""Rhymes Like Dimes"", Doom and Tommy Gunn flowing like blood brothers on ""The Finest"", or the Monsta Island Czars posse cut ""Who You Think I Am?"", Doomsday is above all else an extremely accessible album. In most ways, Doomsday doesn't work on a heady plane: Topically, the majority of it centers around mic skills, women, stick-ups, and alcohol. Though you're never too far removed from a dazzling run of internal rhymes or an ""oh shit!"" pop-culture namedrop, there's no rhymin' for the sake of riddlin'. Doom's technique, vocabulary, and knack for trivia never asks that you come away impressed. He approaches lyrics the same way he does beats, unearthing gems hidden in plain sight, completely legible without a quick check of Google or Roget's.
Doomsday is often held up as Doom's masterpiece, in part because it's a beachhead upon which he'd begin an astonishing five-year run: as King Gheedorah, 2003's Take Me to Your Leader was a more prominent display of his production prowess, while in terms of sheer lyrical mastery, Vaudeville Villain has few peers. And of course, there's Madvillainy, his crowning achievement. Doomsday does have its imperfections and perhaps more than the LPs to follow. Some of its minor flaws can be read as lo-fi charm, the droning wheezes of Scooby-Doo flip ""Hey"" bleeding into the red, and the ""slow it up, speed it up"" gimmick of ""Tick, Tick..."" outstaying its welcome. And of course, there are the skits and the guest appearances from his Monsta Island Czar crew, which are charming but have little replay value.
The album goes a long way toward demonstrating Doom's incalculable influence on some of the leading lights of current underground hip-hop: Lil B has dedicated an entire album to Doom, the lurching production style of Odd Future owes him a heavy debt (most obviously shown in ""Odd Toddlers"" flipping the same sample as 2004's ""One Beer""), and K.M.D.'s referential raps and playful yet incisive deconstructions of racial politics are a clear influence on Das Racist.
And while Doomsday is a must-hear in just about any format, I can't give enough credit to Metal Face for the actual packaging of the Deluxe Edition. If there's any feeling of sticker shock, you are definitely not simply rebuying a record. The collection of bonus tracks and beats might get a one-time tryout by non-obsessives, but the lunchbox and commemorative playing cards included here are beautifully designed collectors items that justify the purchase price. The coolest inclusion, though, is what brought us here in the first place: the lyrics, fully transcribed and collected with comic sketches and new artwork. Appropriately, the thing is so thick it barely fits into the CD case.",2011-04-25T06:00:01,['Rap'],8.9,Metalface,MF DOOM: Operation: Doomsday Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15359-operation-doomsday/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2011-04-25,-0.44246575342465755,2011.25,0.0
68,Made to Love Magic,['Nick Drake'],"The backside of Nick Drake's headstone, wedged deep into the earth of Tanworth-in-Arden's parish church graveyard, reads: ""Now ...
The backside of Nick Drake's headstone, wedged deep into the earth of Tanworth-in-Arden's parish church graveyard, reads: ""Now we rise and we are everywhere."" The words were penned by Drake in 1974; 30 years later, they seem jarringly prophetic.
Like nearly all prematurely buried cult figures, Nick Drake is reinvented each time he is rediscovered. In 2000, the sheepish, astral musings of ""Pink Moon"" became synonymous with backing a Cabrio convertible out of a house party, sparking an unlikely boost in record sales and propelling Pink Moon towards platinum status nearly 26 years after Drake's death. But with each well-intentioned revival of interest, Nick Drake slips further and further out of reach, hopelessly martyred and codified, superceded and consumed by his own tragic context. Nick Drake has become: the 26-year-old prophet, the diffident enigma, the tortured precursor to Kurt Cobain, the fallen hero, the folksinger-as-folksymbol, the self-sacrificing patron saint of lonely, disaffected teenagers-- the One who died for our sins.
Even now, being indoctrinated into the cult of Drake is stupidly easy. Line the unbearably poetic circumstances of Drake's death (swallowing a fatal handful of anti-depressants, either deliberately or by accident) against the soft melancholy of his tiny canon, and witness a very specific kind of bedroom deity being birthed: Drake's three proper studio records form a bulletproof triumvirate, synergizing to create an impossibly satisfying (and telling) arc, riddled with prescient pull-quotes and expectedly dynamic emotions. Given the irrefutable magnificence of what he left behind, it's always seemed perfectly logical to assume that every single thing Nick Drake ever did should be worth piles of attention. And really, who wants to know if it's not?
Thus, it's only appropriate to approach each new Drake compilation with a bit of honest trepidation, and to be anxious about the sullying of an otherwise pristine recording career. Nick Drake wrote, recorded, and released three records between 1968 and his mysterious death in 1974, but the subsequent permutation of capitalistic yearning and superfan desperation saw Drake's discography significantly (and mercilessly) puffed up by a handful of dubious posthumous releases. Some of these efforts have been worthwhile (the excellent Time of No Reply, which rounded out the first reissue of the Fruit Tree box, and Heaven Is a Wildflower, both released in 1986), some renegade (the widely distributed Tanworth-in-Arden Home Recordings and Second Grace) and some completely superfluous (1994's sloppy Way to Blue, which unapologetically regurgitates, unchanged, ten of Heaven Is a Wildflower's fourteen tracks). In 1994, Drake's pioneering producer, Joe Boyd, promised Mojo: ""Everything releasable has been released.""
Compiled by engineer John Wood and former roommate Robert Kirby, Made to Love Magic is a footnote, a hiccup, a voyeuristic peepshow. It is not a revelation. Completists will revel in the resuscitation of rare/unheard tracks, including two Cambridge-era dorm demos (""Mayfair"", ""River Man""), outtakes from the Five Leaves Left sessions (""Joey"", ""Clothes of Sand""), remastered stereo versions of the mono mixes that appeared on Time of No Reply (""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Black-Eyed Dog"", ""Hanging on a Star""), two tracks with strings re-orchestrated and re-recorded by Kirby (""I Was Made to Love Magic"", ""Time of No Reply""), an early rendition of ""Three Hours"" (with Drake backed by an anonymous flautist and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, later of Can and Traffic), and even causal fans will be anxious to hear the recently discovered Drake original, ""Tow the Line."" Recorded just four months before Drake's death, ""Tow the Line"" has been loudly touted as the last song Drake ever committed to tape, and his pale, listless vocals do little to detract from the artist-on-the-edge theatrics so implicit in that tag-- the song would fit neatly on Pink Moon, its frail lyrics and stark strums easily maintaining the fatalistic mood of Drake's final record.
""Tow the Line"" may be Made to Love Magic's big selling point, but it's hardly the only attraction: Robert Kirby's sprawling new string arrangement on the title track, while conceptually awkward (and vaguely disingenuous), proves a marked improvement over the maudlin squealings available on previous versions. Still, Kirby can do little to stop ""I Was Made to Love Magic"" from sounding like a ridiculous, fawning homage to Walt Disney, all maudlin, unconvincing swoons and gooey swells, with Drake goofily crooning the song's title.
Despite the best intentions of its creators, Made to Love Magic feels disjointed and weird, and even the most mundane of improvements somehow still seem contrived-- the new, stereo mix of ""Black Eyed Dog"" shatters the stark precariousness of the original, wherein Drake, barely singing, howled blankly: ""I'm growing old/ And I don't wanna know/ I'm growing old/ And I wanna go home."" Bolstered by a thick and ominous slathering of tape hiss, the bootleg version of ""Black Eyed Dog"" violently suggested, however inadvertently, that Drake might not make it all the way through the song-- and that tension only ever added to its morose appeal. In some ways, Made to Love Magic nobly attempts to strip Drake of his signifiers, and to cut him loose from his cross. But broadcasting Drake's comparably mediocre drippings won't alter his deification, at least not significantly. All it really does is muddy up the water a bit.",2004-05-26T05:00:01,['Folk/Country'],6.7,Island,Nick Drake: Made to Love Magic Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2445-made-to-love-magic/,reviews/albums,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2004-05-26,-7.36027397260274,2004.25,0.0
69,Lucid Interval,['Cephalic Carnage'],"I've got a steamy little nugget of truth for all of you dedicated Pitchfork readers: heavy metal is the ...
I've got a steamy little nugget of truth for all of you dedicated Pitchfork readers: heavy metal is the counter-culture's answer to chain-smoking. This is absolute gospel truth. Try as we might, and directly in the face of myriad warnings telling us to stray from the ills of cigarette smoke and those fire-branding demons of metal, there are still thousands upon thousands of us sucking down butts and banging our heads like morons every single day.
With Surgeon General's warning labels, The Insider, iron lungs, and television commercials featuring skinny hipster kids on street corners trying to convince us that Philip Morris is still pulling the wool over the eyes of a few muddle-headed sheep, we've got ample incentive to avoid those delightful little cylinders of tar like the plague. But every once in a while, something comes along to rekindle the flame. Whether it's a fantastic metal album or a found carton of Chesterfields, we'll take the opportunity to heave the largest cloud of nicotine right in your faces, because we know it prays upon your puritanical self-hatred, and in plain black and white, we know you hate it.
Fortunately for those who enjoy blowing smoke in the faces of their friends and family, an ultra-carcinogen called Lucid Interval was created this past August, by gore-metal Ubermensches Cephalic Carnage. Mutating equal parts grind, fusion jazz, prog, and hardcore might seem ludicrous-- it's bombastic, loud, and impulsive-- but this is one of the most brutal, technically sophisticated, and unabashed Metal records I've heard in a very long time.
Stretching death metal to its absolute limit has always been the primary interest of Colorado's Cephalic Carnage. Previous releases Conforming to Abnormality and Exploiting Dysfunction laid the groundwork for this genesis to absurdity, combining the gory brutality of their peers in Cock and Ball Torture, the death metal comedic ethos of Cannibal Corpse, and the sweeping chaos of Exhumed. Lucid Interval finds Cephalic Carnage pushing its earlier dynamic to the fullest extreme, with mind-blowing results.
From the opening seconds of ""Scolopendra Cingulata"", it's painfully apparent this album is an aneurysm waiting to happen. Introducing high frequency trepanation in the vein of Whitehouse, a meticulous grind and seismic bass slowly give way to the horrifying growls of vocalists Lenzig (lead vocals) and Jawash (also on bass) during the album's second track, ""Fortuitous Oddity"".
Lenzig has the ability to move between the guttural growls of grindcore-- the kind of stuff that sounds like a herd of pigs slaughtering Farmer Bill and his wife-- and the high-pitched screams of noisecore, while the band follows every vocal nuance apace. With violent death metal riffs degenerating into mock blues, then back to blistering hammerbeat in a matter of seconds, Cephalic Carnage have taken a fairly conventional New York death metal aesthetic and twisted it into a sound so much more advanced and sinewy than that of their contemporaries. Drummer John (who oddly enough bears a passing resemblance to Moby) blasts through double-kick and syncopated jazz licks with mathematical precision and power, while guitarists Zak and Steve race up and down the fretboard inexhaustibly. There's nothing close to a missed note here, no indication of timidity or restraint: Lucid Interval is simply a brutal, a furious, abrasive forty-five minutes of the very best experimental grindcore.
This is an album of faux starts and stops, limitless innovation, and full-on cranial overload. ""Pseudo"" is their foray into avant-garde jazz territory, replete with sounds pulled right out of the Mego catalog; the humorously titled ""Black Metal Sabbath"" combines that genre's shrieks with the stoner drone of labelmates High on Fire. The title track features Swedish metal crescendos in the style of Marduk and Bathory, while ""Arsonist Savior"" utilizes gore-grind electronics-- a la Catasexual Urge Motivation-- and the power chord harmonics of Incantation. Hell, there's even a fifty second mariachi interlude called ""Cannibism"".
For all you metalheads and smokers out there, sit back, light up, and enjoy this masterpiece from Cephalic Carnage. Lucid Interval displays the band's full panoply of disparate styles and influences with deft originality and quality, sans any indication of softening its brutal exoskeleton. In case anyone around you starts to cough, wheeze, or gasp for breath, remember the immortal words of Bill Hicks: ""non-smokers die every single day.""",2003-01-27T06:00:02,"['Jazz', 'Metal']",8.1,Relapse,Cephalic Carnage: Lucid Interval Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1380-lucid-interval/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2003-01-27,-8.689041095890412,2003.0,0.0
70,Osirus: The Official Mixtape,['Ol’ Dirty Bastard'],"Whoever's handling the craziest Wu-Tang motherfucker's estate has wasted no time in getting out this posthumous ""official mixtape,"" a teaser for his Rocafella finale, due later this yea.
In the rap family portrait, Ol' Dirty Bastard was the Downsy 30-year-old cousin with his pants pulled down. Nobody asked him to do this obviously, and though the scene was gross, nobody protested either. Everybody just laughed-- the only option, really. ODB had so successfully blurred the line between playing the fool and actually being retarded, nobody would dare criticize him for fear of seeming pointlessly cruel or, worse, painfully out of the loop. ODB was better than a fool though: Not only did he say and do what others didn't, but where fools get away with their foolishness, ODB fell victim to his own heedlessness at every turn. He lived the life-- cash money, bitches, crack, fast cars, etc.-- but unlike others, ODB always suffered the consequences: poverty, child support, crippling addiction, prison, and traffic violations. ODB was simultaneously everything and nothing most MCs want to be.
A few seconds into ""Pop Shots""-- the lead track on the posthumous Osirus: The Official Mixtape-- ODB invokes his most foolish public display, that surprise interruption of Puffy's Grammy acceptance speech in 1998. ""Look here, more money, more problems, my ass/ You're a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real/ That's a trick to try to keep you where you at/ All content, while niggas ridin' Bentleys and Maybach"", the fool says. He's right to chide, wrong to look past the personal contradiction but in the end completely unassailable, if only because he's ODB.
At this point only our coolest friends can say, ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" when they break their own rules. Really though, no one-- maybe not even Rick James himself-- deserves the line more than ODB. Nigga Please made the Superfreak/ODB kinship explicit, and the best tracks on Osirus pin Dirt's ululations and double-edged sex-crazed rants on cold-blooded, rubber-band funk. An early tit-for-tat with Rhymefest on ""Dirty Dirty"" makes the gluttonous ODB sound like a permanent morality play: ""What can make a ho look more cuter?/ Hennessy shots and smoke more buddha/ [I don't know, Dirt, now she look like Jab Zuda/ Test my manhood go get my dick ruler]/ Now you're hungry wanna eat right through her"". Similarly, none of us should ever command a girl, ""Come sit on Mini-Me and put a smile on Dr. Evil,"" as on slow jam ""P*ssy Keep Calling"", but we're happy ODB said it-- if only to remind us that we shouldn't. Says Rhymefest, ""What's rap without Dirt? What's the whole world without Dirt? Just a bunch of fucking water.""
Extend the dirt/water boast to the rapper/producer relationship on Osirus, and we get to the mixtape's biggest flaws-- most beats are shit, and guests flow muddily. This isn't The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones Part II, but RZA's production is again sorely missed. When tracks go retro-thug without a hitch (several of them do), ODB just sounds past-prime and pathetic: ""If y'all want war/ let's get it on/ Cause we don't care/ Where y'all from"" is a career nadir. ""Down South"" is, I guess, a Lil Jon crunk send-up, but the song's too listless to make a point of it.
However official this mixtape says it is, Osirus is still just a test run for Ol' Dirty Bastard's more official posthumous release on Roc-A-Fella later this year. Which is good news, of course. For every posthumous album, there's a Posthumous Album Game to be played, and hardcore ODB fans will surely pore over his last release hoping to uncover a death prophecy. Perfect fool that he is though, ODB has been hinting at his death since the beginning of his career. Every asinine rhyme he's dropped, every child support check he hasn't paid, every little girl he's saved from a moving vehicle's impact-- from all these, we can be sure ODB intimately understood his fate. Otherwise, wow, what a fucking retard that guy was.",2005-01-12T06:00:01,['Rap'],6.4,Sure Shot,Ol’ Dirty Bastard: Osirus: The Official Mixtape Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6104-osirus-the-official-mixtape/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2005-01-12,-6.727397260273973,2005.0,0.0
71,RR7349,['S U R V I V E'],"Much more than mood-setters for Stranger Things, the synth masters of S U R V I V E carve out a compelling niche of their own.
Overnight success is rarely that, but in the case of experimental synth group S U R V I V E, you’d be forgiven for assuming that they arrived fully-formed this past summer. Two of their members collaborated on the Stranger Things OST, Vol. One and Two, the soundtrack to Netflix’s zeitgeist-consuming sci-fi TV series. Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein’s uncanny ear for ’80s synthesizers—not to mention their proclivity for building their own from scratch—was absolutely perfect for scoring a supernatural thriller set in the Reagan Era. But as one-half of S U R V I V E’s four-person outfit (they’re joined by Adam Jones and Mark Donica, on even more synths), they now find themselves at a crossroads. With the band’s newfound success, their fans will surely be looking for the points of reference that hooked them in the first place: the film compositions of John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream, Giorgio Moroder, and even Vangelis’ less grandiose moments.
And while those influences are abundant on their new album RR7349, the challenge here, as with any band who becomes suddenly popular, is to avoid that albatross and temper those expectations with enough individuality to stay true to their core sound and identity. It's not an easy balance, but the album gets there, and once it settles into its slick groove, is unrelenting in its deconstruction of their soundtrack work.
Despite, or perhaps because of the restrictions of their instrumentation, S U R V I V E’s music has gone through a range of tones and atmospheres since their inception only seven years ago. 2012’s HD009 (all of the band's releases are simply titled after their catalog number) consists of two tracks, both exactly 22:06 minutes long, interacting like mirrored reflections of the same ambient piece of music. That year they also released Mnq026, a record that more closely resembles the structure and tone of the Stranger Things OST, while maintaining the eerie sparsity that permeated their music up to that point.
However, the slight of hand that S U R V I V E recreate across all of their records has nothing to do with ambiance, or underrated cinematic touchstones, or even their vast knowledge of their cherished instruments, which, credit where credit’s due, rightfully make up for much of the band's appeal. The most difficult part of making instrumental, non-dance electronic music for an audience beyond your typical avant-garde connoisseur is injecting it with a sense of narrative, a story, an energy that replaces vocals and conventional musical structures to give the tracks an augmented dimension. S U R V I V E are very good at this. They may be one of the best bands currently employing those skills, and RR7349 is their most succinct example yet.
As engrossing and brilliant as the Stranger Things OST is, its success relies, much like the TV series, largely on its capacity to mimic the feel of an era. There’s not a moment on it that is as stomach-lurching as “Dirt,” an early highlight of RR7349; like most of the tracks on the album, it's sensory almost to the point of overwhelmingness. The pulsating “Sorcerer” is built around a harsh, driving percussive synth line that bulldozes almost everything underneath it, and when a drum machine actually does pierce through the layers and layers of foggy keyboards, like on “Copter,” it’s so arresting it almost jolts you out of your seat.
The album closes with “Cutthroat,” its best track, a composition so deliciously creepy you almost wish it were accompanying a particularly splattery scene of mayhem. Its arpeggiated squelches swirl in an unsettling void until, little by little, deep bass and tinkering chimes begin to seep in, and suddenly, the next thing you know, you're caught under the weight of the track's increasing paranoia. Based on “Cutthroat” alone, it’s clear that S U R V I V E’s capacity for imagination and evocation goes well beyond homages to film scores of the 1980s, and much like the machines they meticulously build to create their dense soundscapes, they’ll continue to tweak and augment their sound until the unholy day their monstrous creation is completed.",2016-10-01T05:00:00,['Electronic'],7.4,Relapse,S U R V I V E: RR7349 Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22430-rr7349/,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2016-10-01,4.998630136986302,2016.75,0.0
72,The Civil War,['Matmos'],"Not since their self-titled 1997 debut have M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel simply assembled a bunch of tracks and ...
Not since their self-titled 1997 debut have M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel simply assembled a bunch of tracks and called it an album. Since then, the duo has placed concepts first, even while their execution has remained elastic: sometimes their overriding intent dominates a single track; sometimes the connection between a song and the whole is threadlike at best. I'm partial to their last full-length, 2001's A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure, but for some Matmos fans, their masterpiece remains 1999's The West, their least conceptually unified album since that first outing. The West contains guitar and other stringed instruments that, in places, evoke the Sergio Leone ""big sky"" of the Western landscape, but it also has a fair amount of abstract electronic noise without any particular association. Matmos had something in particular in mind for The West as a whole, but they weren't afraid to follow the tracks where they wanted to go.
The Civil War, Matmos' latest, is cut from a similar cloth as The West, but with a more overt and unified concept. The through line this time is the martial music of war-- specifically the civil wars of America's north and south, and the British civil war of the 17th century. Banjos, tubas, penny whistles, rolling snares, bagpipes-- sounds and textures from these conflicts are embedded in the folk music of the English-speaking world, and on The Civil War, Matmos create from them through sampling, processing, editing and arranging.
As a technical achievement and as a piece of pure sound, The Civil War is inarguably Matmos' best record. Past Matmos albums have tried to create music from stranger sources and the results, while frequently brilliant and often amusing, sometimes lacked the sonic punch to put them over the top. The raw materials here are things like piano, electric guitar, drums, and hurdy gurdy, so naturally this is far and the away the most musical Matmos we've heard. The instrumental palette was beautifully designed, the layering and detail is amazing, and the computer often goes completely undetected-- in places, it really does sound like a credible string band arranged by someone from the 21st Century.
Another parallel between this album and The West lies in its lack of dancefloor accessibility: the loose-limbed funk that wormed its way through A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure is nowhere to be found here. This is, of course, entirely appropriate considering The Civil War's overriding theme. Instead, we get tracks like ""Y.T.T.E."", whose drums and bass swing hard, forming a groove that sounds something like a combination of ""Bo Diddley"" and ""You Can't Hurry Love"". At nine minutes, it's one of the record's two centerpieces (the other being the equally long ""Reconstruction""), featuring Acetone frontman Mark Lightcap's guitar dancing nimbly above the beat. As the percussion splinters and then fades, Lightcap codas with an effective bit of internal Maggot Brain-style soloing.
""For the Trees"" slows things down with the kind of behind-the-beat shuffle that's become something of a Matmos trademark, and it works just right against the piano and violin, evoking a sepia-toned portrait of a lazy afternoon in the deep south. The track's closing reprise strips away any trace of electronics and coasts into the horizon on an acoustic cloud. The send-up of ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", meanwhile, is a sharp statement, skewering the pomposity of John Philip Sousa with dinky sounds and unsteady rhythms while secretly celebrating the spectacle of it all.
I have a feeling that Matmos' concepts serve mostly to constrict the limitless possibilities of sampling and sequencing-- deciding to use a fixed set of sounds necessarily limits choice, which has to feel good when you've mastered the computer and the world is your orchestra. But sound and production aside, something isn't quite there. ""Reconstruction"", for example, follows a brilliant arc from a messy beginning of electronic squelches, reaches a jaunty middle with marching drums and a snappy guitar riff, then dissolves into a Reichian tremble of dense repeating keyboards before finally coming out the other side with a delicate banjo/steel guitar refrain. The construction of the thing is fantastic, the pacing just right, and yet, when that mournful banjo does its Bud Cort walk into the sunset, I just can't escape the feeling that there's less of an emotional core here than on previous offerings-- that the concept has perhaps taken too much precedence over the visceral delivery. As such, The Civil War, while impossible not to like, is difficult to love.",2003-10-13T05:00:00,['Experimental'],7.3,Matador,Matmos: The Civil War Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5152-the-civil-war/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2003-10-13,-7.97945205479452,2003.75,0.0
73,Dream Dentistry,['LoDeck'],"One of the defining features of underground hip-hop is how the two most contentious factors to success are so opposite ...
One of the defining features of underground hip-hop is how the two most contentious factors to success are so opposite. The artists with the largest fanbases are either deeply rooted in tradition or defined by their eccentricity. The ones with the most important impact, however, have a certain way of combining both portions into a single, equal serving. Falling upon this ambiguous sub-region is Johnny23 Records CEO and artist LoDeck, with his debut LP, Dream Dentistry.
A concise arrangement of philosophical pondering and bass-heavy beats, the album is driven by Deck's rhyming style. He writes like Aesop Rock mixed with Redman, but his hung-over, rusty, cracking New Yorker vocals and devil-may-care charisma call for comparison to rappers like Sticky Fingaz and MF Doom. In short: LoDeck raps like the Ivy League freshman that went to Daytona Beach for Spring Break and never came back to school.
A natural New York-dirty punchline master, LoDeck attempts to power you into his fanclub with subtle jabs and crosses. Not only is he ""too ill/ Like Eazy-E at 'Tha Crossroads',"" but if he's ""too predictable,"" he'll ""twist up like Blanka."" Even when he spits out ""The Russian ain't playin'/ My real name is Boris,"" his delivery redeems the randomness of the line. His concepts include the negatives of the idiot box on ""Inside the TV"", the misunderstandings surrounding the societal standing of underground emcees on ""Applause"" (""You want a satellite dish? All us rappers are rich!""), and the nature of affection on the aptly titled ""Love"". LoDeck's major issue is that his meandering stream-of-consciousness flow often sacrifices coherency, topical restraint and consistency for a tighter flow, which, by the end of most of his tracks, tends lose any of the concepts he began with. It does make for an enjoyably raw listening experience but a level of sustained conceptual depth could help him to cross the bridge into Classic County.
""Word is Virus"" is a highlight, regardless of the lame freezing glitch-hop beat and corny vocal sample, featuring Paramount and sub-underground superhero Mac Lethal. After LoDeck proclaims his ""loopy crew acts like soccer thugs with one goal"" and that he's ""blessed with the same charm that freezes cobras,"" Paramount sleepwalks through a flow-oriented verse, leaving room for Lethal to steal the show. Opening by pantomiming Beanie Sigel, Mac twists and contorts his delivery around his Midwest battle style, offering a loose, bouncy alternative to the stark ambiguity of Deck and Paramount: ""Your crew's about as thuggy as the Shriners/ Rocking turbans made out of trash can liners.""
Flanked by producers FredONE, Chum Chopz, Big DeEP and perennial Aesop Rock beatmaker Blockhead, the beats on Dream Dentistry definitely disappoint when paired with LoDeck's vocal assault. The Blockhead compositions rise above the others with the aura of professionalism that made LoDeck's Bash It! EP such a stark triumph-- unfortunately, nothing on this record touches ""Stethoscope Alley"" or ""I Pollute"" in the realm of production. Chum Chopz, in particular, is hit/miss. ""Watchtower"" runs romper stomper with hard drums and a spiral staircase bassline that works well, but ""Love"" is rendered almost unlistenable by tinny guitar licks and a sloppy choral vocal sample.
Of course, even if his lack of song structure and freeform rhyming throws some people off, LoDeck has clearly evolved his lyrical status since the ridiculously dope Bash It! EP; it's just that, here, he's lost the beats, and still yet to gain songwriting focus. His next project could hold a deeper listening experience; in the meantime, Dream Dentistry remains a powerful testament to his novel rap style.",2003-09-30T05:00:03,['Rap'],7.1,Johnny23,LoDeck: Dream Dentistry Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4952-dream-dentistry/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2003-09-30,-8.015068493150684,2003.5,0.0
74,A Strange Arrangement,['Mayer Hawthorne'],"
Stones Throw's one-man soul band is almost too sweet for his own good.

A Strange Arrangement, in addition to being the name of Mayer Hawthorne's falsetto-laced debut, also describes the story behind the making of this one-man soul studio. Performing in L.A. as DJ Haircut, Michigan-born hip-hop fan Drew Cohen thought it would be interesting to record his own sample-friendly music. His complicated form of crate digging eventually attracted the ears of Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf. According to a Real Detroit Weekly interview*,* Cohen even turned to the adolescent-approved porn name formula-- his middle name and the street he grew up on-- as a device for creating his sweet soul singer alter ego. When he received a recording contract for what he thought was a single release, he realized Wolf wanted a full-length and had to bunker down, since he ended up writing and recording just about every part on the album himself. It's not as authentic and gritty a bio as those found in the liner notes of many soul reissues. But Hawthorne's on-the-fly origins are fitting for this release, alternately carefree, charming, and sometimes as green as the 29-year-old crooner.
Hawthorne's smooth voice draws deeply from the work of legends like Smokey Robinson, Curtis Mayfield, and the Stylistics' Russell Thompkins, Jr. While his naming convention may suggest otherwise, Hawthorne never gets near any R-rated love affairs. Posing in a study surrounded by ephemera on the cover, he sort of looks like a lost Tenenbaum, and plays up a lovelorn, sweet angle throughout the album.
He shines brightest on straightforward tracks where he doesn't overplay his hand, instead folding his innocent vocals into catchy, energetic, and unfussy arrangements. He can't match the instrumental chops of Daptone bands or Mark Ronson projects, so he sticks to the basics. Coasting on driving backbeats, feel-good horn and sax melodies, and pleas for passion, ""Your Easy Lovin' Ain't Pleasin' Nothin'"", ""One Track Mind"", and ""Make Her Mine"" are streamlined soul, catchy singles that do right by their obvious 1960s influences. ""The Ills"" nails a Mayfield vibe out of the gate, threading fluid congas among empowering choruses and lyrics about broken levees and single-parent families. ""A Strange Arrangement"" and ""Just Ain't Gonna Work Out"", mid-tempo numbers with more falsetto and apologies for walking away from relationships, showcase blended vocal harmonies. Other than the occasional clockwork backbeat, the closest this comes to Cohen's hip-hop roots is when he slurs ""scared"" so it rhymes with ""bird.""
The lovelorn singer doesn't always handle being on the receiving end of a break up quite as well. While lamenting on ""Just Ain't Gonna Work Out"", his syrupy vocals stall a bit, and ""Green Eyed Love"" lumbers along on a half-hearted organ melody and slack rhythm. Hawthorne clearly has the ability to integrate and recreate his influences in his own compositions; it would be revelatory if he added more of his own signature sounds and soul into the music.",2009-10-02T06:00:04,['Pop/R&B'],6.9,Stones Throw,Mayer Hawthorne: A Strange Arrangement Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13508-a-strange-arrangement/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2009-10-02,-2.004109589041096,2009.75,0.0
75,Miro Tape,['Duppy Gun'],"Sun Araw and M. Geddes Gengras’ Duppy Gun teams with producers from Bristol label Bokeh Versions on a dub mixtape that tests the limits of the genre.
Cameron Stallones and M. Geddes Gengras conceived the Duppy Gun Productions label following a formative trip to Jamaica. After recording with reggae legends the Congos for the 2012 LP Icon Give Thank, the Los Angeles-based musicians built relationships with a new guard of Jamaican vocalists, including I Jahbar, Early One, and Sikka Rymes. Duppy Gun matches those voices with experimentally minded producers, usually from Stallones’ (aka Sun Araw) and Gengras’ extended circle in the States. The collaboration has grown more rooted over time, with I Jahbar helming the label’s new studio in Jamaica.
For Duppy Gun’s latest release, the vocalists joined forces with dub innovators like Jay Glass Dubs, Abu Ama, and the British Columbia collective Seekersinternational, in pairings facilitated by another like-minded but physically distant label, Bristol’s Bokeh Versions. The result is Miro Tape, two 25-minute sides that edit together 23 tracks (most of them previously unreleased) in the style of a mixtape. It’s a format that suits the project well, offering listeners a concise introduction to the cross-pollinating international network of musicians whose work is often categorized as leftfield dub and dancehall. Submerged in contiguous waters, these diverse compositions achieve a cacophonous flow, with individual authorship—particularly where riddims are concerned—taking a backseat to collaboration.
Duppy Gun has cultivated a reputation for production so outré, it verges on extraterrestrial, and Miro is no exception. The tape begins at a sprint, with the rapid-fire dancehall of “Love Di People,” featuring Sikka Rymes, and “Mad,” with vocals by I Jahbar and Early One. Instrumentals by D/P/I and Butchy Fuego, respectively, match the singers’ pace, peeling out in a barrage of bleating sirens and start-and-stop bass textures. As Miro eases into dubbier territory, the producers’ maximalist approaches to layering converge, to satisfying effect. But an exhilarating sense of unsteadiness continues to reign, both in the murky plateaus that mark transitions between tracks and, sometimes, within the tracks themselves: “Beeki Boy,” for example, which teams I Jahbar with producers Big Flyte & Velkro, sets an odd, stuttering pace beneath a bright, guitar-like riff. The prominence of the vocals fluctuates, giving a dynamic, liquid shape to the sound. Details like these confirm that Duppy Gun tracks are crafted to be heard through headphones as well as sound systems.
Some of Miro is resolutely—and even aggressively—weird; the collaborators often seem less interested in pushing dub forward than in stretching the genre so far that it approaches a different form entirely. But a few tracks, particularly on the more relaxed B-side, glow with reverence for the history they engage: As Ras G and Lopo’s “Whereabouts” flows into I Jahbar and Big Flyte & Velkro’s “Turn Up,” the latter song weighs down its predecessor’s errant laser pulses with a syrupy, almost nostalgic melody. Miro Tape is thrilling in moments like this, when the past and the future smudge together, immersing the listener in sounds defined only by their boundless pliability.",2018-05-02T05:00:00,['Experimental'],7.4,Bokeh Versions ,Duppy Gun: Miro Tape Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/duppy-gun-miro-tape/,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2018-05-02,6.582191780821918,2018.25,0.0
76,Chant Darling,['Lawrence Arabia'],"Bella Union uproots another 60s pop-loving artist, releasing the U.S. debut from James Milne, who has played with the Ruby Suns and Okkervil River.
There's something almost charmingly old-fashioned about James Milne's U.S. debut as Lawrence Arabia. There's of course that cinematic pseudonym, alluding to a Hollywood epic almost half a century old. There's also his unyielding devotion to 1960s pop music, which treats the Beatles catalog as untrod territory. But mostly it's the New Zealander's steadfast refusal to join any current pop trend, indie or otherwise, which seems a bit surprising given that Milne has played with the Ruby Suns, the Brunettes, and Okkervil River. He distances himself so far from the present that he actually sounds somewhat distinctive. Pop history, however, is littered with those who have taken up the Fab mantle to high praise, from Jim Noir all the way back to Todd Rundgren and beyond.
Which is only to say that Milne is no outsider. His well-schooled command of hooks and pomp does not make him unique, just obsessive and perhaps a bit single-minded. In fact, his debut's primary limitation is that for all his fifth-Beatle vocals and the loose Höfner plunk of his basslines, Chant Darling seeks to imitate, not to innovate. At times it sounds like nothing we haven't heard before, but there are, of course, pleasures to be found in this approach, like the snaky guitar and snappy hook of ""Apple Pie Bed"", the chipper calypso sample that forms the rhythmic foundation of ""Auckland CBD Part Two"", or the decadent languor of ""I've Smoked Too Much"". Milne lets a lot of ideas loose on this album, and occasionally they get away from him. In particular, he has a tendency to repeat phrases and melodies, striving for hynotic but more often achieving tedious. ""The Undesirables"" run its sleepy hook into the ground in just two minutes, and ""The Beautiful Young Crew"" tugs obsessively at its knotty melody.
Lyrically, Milne can be slyly witty and genially self-deprecating, as on the opener, ""Like a Fool"". ""I'm on the ground, girl, I'm thrashing 'round,"" he sings. ""It's easy to see what this display is for, to show you what you mean to me."" In addition to anchoring him in the here and now, that sense of haplessness is at direct odds with the song's dapper arrangements; if his thoughts are scattered, his music remains suave and martini sophisticated. Chant Darling doesn't hit strike that balance often enough, and very few of these songs allow such a glimpse of the musician behind them. Ultimately, Lawrence Arabia's carefully tailored influences have the same effect as that stage name, as if Milne was intent on absenting himself from his own album.",2010-03-22T06:00:04,['Rock'],6.3,Bella Union,Lawrence Arabia: Chant Darling Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14024-chant-darling/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2010-03-22,-1.5356164383561643,2010.0,0.0
77,Tarot Sport,['Fuck Buttons'],"Best new music
The second full-length from this noisy Bristol duo is more accessible than their first but sacrifices none of that record's visceral power.
Like any noise group, Fuck Buttons rely on a certain amount of vulgarity and aggression. While they've always possessed a knack for melody that has, for their genre, provided their music with an accessible edge, listeners unaccustomed to blood-curdling screams and metal-scraping drones have had their work cut out for them when searching for the more delicate moments that helped make last year's Street Horrrsing such a stunning listen.
Tarot Sport represents a subtler, more mature approach to songwriting and a sharpening of their craft. But moreso, it marks a comprehensive stylistic shift for the duo's sound, from experimental noise with a buried pop sensibility to a sort of modernized electronic take on classic post-rock structures. And impressively, they've made these changes without sacrificing any of the genre-straddling adventurousness that made them intriguing in the first place.
Perhaps the best way to think about their transformation is to consider how the new material relates to post-rock groups like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The band has always had an inclination toward sweeping epics (see: ""Sweet Love for Planet Earth""), but instead of using scale as a canvas for brutality/delicacy contrasts, here they repurpose the post-rock format as a digital soundscape. Gone are the shrieks and wailing guitar chords that populated Street Horrrsing; instead these songs are built almost wholly with synth and keyboard textures that originate in dance music.
Aiding the shift is producer Andrew Weatherall, who has a long history of infusing rock with dancefloor bounce and drawing the best from his groups. (His helming of Primal Scream's epochal Screamadelica and his remix work with My Bloody Valentine are prime examples.) From the chugging drumbeat of opener ""Surf Solar"" to the chipped-up electro backdrop of finale ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"", the dynamics and textures of techno are the foundation of the record, making a direct link between Tarot and Weatherall's earlier boundary-defying productions.
All of which is prologue to Tarot Sport's actual songs, which by and large are pretty freaking incredible. There's a cinematic, storytelling quality to the music, and the climactic builds of longer pieces such as ""The Lisbon Maru""-- with its militaristic drumbeat and huge synth melodies-- conjure the excitement of an oversized movie sequence. ""Surf Solar"", extended from the clipped-length radio edit that emerged online last month, is anxious and menacing by comparison but hits those notes without the histrionics of Fuck Buttons' previous work-- the band seems just too confident here to rely on screeches to get its point across.
Fuck Buttons also master shorter pieces that shift and redirect the record's momentum. Close in spirit to the tribal romp of ""Ribs Out"" from Street Horrrsing-- but ultimately more listenable and imaginative-- ""Rough Steez"" envisions industrial techno as locomotive skronk. And ""Phantom Limb"" recalls genre-benders like Liquid Liquid and Gang Gang Dance with its cavernous atmosphere and snaky, complex arrangement. When the band returns to widescreen emotiveness for the triumphant closer ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"", it feels like a victory lap-- the capper on a record that is a hell of a lot easier to like than even fans of Street Horrrsin**g would have expected. That was a great record, but Tarot Sport is a cut above. Perhaps surprisingly, it's also a welcoming album-- and one of the best of this already fruitful year.",2009-10-23T06:00:00,['Electronic'],9.0,ATP,Fuck Buttons: Tarot Sport Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2009-10-23,-1.9465753424657535,2009.75,0.0
78,My Bloody Underground,['The Brian Jonestown Massacre'],"Given its title, it's fitting that this self-produced record attempts to emulate both the gauzy atmospherics of My Bloody Valentine and the sparse efficiency of the Velvet Underground.
Back when the Brian Jonestown Massacre became the newest Next Big Thing-- releasing albums at the rate of Bob Pollard powered by Red Bull, flirting with interested record labels of varying liquidity, engaging in slapfights with the Dandy Warhols and fistfights with bandmates-- the myth and mystique surrounding the group all but drowned out its songs. All the while, frontman Anton Newcombe wanted people to believe he was a burgeoning genius bucking the establishment, a tortured outcast inspired by and continuing the work begun by his spiritual forefathers from the 1960s, including one or both of the guys whose names or notorious actions were jacked for use in Newcombe's little beat combo.
With every subsequent release, however, the myth gave way to a less flattering portrait. Although Newcombe was talented enough to skillfully synthesize all sorts of musical touchstones, the end results were increasingly less inspiring, and his tendency to take decent ideas and beat them into the ground was maddening-- Newcombe never failed to take what could be a perfectly fine three-minute song and turn it into an interminable seven-minute dirge. Couple those aesthetic shortcomings with Newcombe's penchant for burning bridges and buying into his own out-of-proportion hype, and it's no wonder that the group quickly became yesterday's news. Ironically, Brian Jonestown Massacre's most public moment came courtesy of the 2004 documentary Dig!, with the film's unflattering portrayal of Newcombe and the group's overwrought inner turmoil showing exactly why the group would never become as big as Newcombe thought they should be. Undaunted, Newcombe and whomever he can sucker into joining his merry band soldier on, releasing records, playing out, causing the occasional ruckus. If the hope is to return to those salad days of potential world domination, lackluster albums like My Bloody Underground aren't going to help the cause.
Given its title, it's fitting that the self-produced My Bloody Underground attempts to emulate both the gauzy atmospherics of My Bloody Valentine and the sparse efficiency of the Velvet Underground. Instead, the album often sounds more like a poorly recorded group of proficient amateurs giving it a go on fourth-hand guitars and some empty paint buckets, with the singer warbling through a pillow for good measure. The album's lead track (the name of which I'll get to later on) starts with a promising beat, but gets sideswiped not three seconds in by the intrusion of the meandering psychedelic guitar mangling one might stereotypically expect from a group beholden to that forever-romanticized era of free love. After six minutes of that, there's an electrified version of the same pointless stumble that lasts just as long. Most of the album offers variations on this sort of unending drone-- ""Who Fucking Pissed in My Well?"" is a non-vocal synth-driven take, ""Just Like Kicking Jesus"" goes the MBV seasick route, ""Who Cares Why"" sends the drone out into orbit, and the album's percussion-free conclusion is fittingly titled ""Black Hole Symphony"". Oddly enough, despite being the longest track on the entire record, it's probably the most palatable.
The songs that avoid this sonic quicksand aren't worth much, either-- successes like the haunting ""Ljosmyndir"" and refreshingly aggressive ""Golden - Frost"" are few and far between. Instead, there's ""Yeah - Yeah"", a haze-free number where Newcombe's usually submerged vocals take center stage to offer a litany of ridiculous couplets. There's also a pleasant enough piano instrumental, supposedly written by Newcombe when he was nine years old, that soon overstays its welcome. And in case the album couldn't be any more obnoxious, the title of this track is ""We Are the Niggers of the World"".
More so than the album's overall malaise and inconsistency, it's this ridiculous (and in some cases, offensive) attempt at ""edginess"" that's most off-putting. Stunts like naming the album's first track ""Bring Me the Head of Paul McCartney on Heather Mills' Wooden Peg (Dropping Bombs on the White House)"", or calling one of Underground's high points ""Automatic Faggot for the People"" are the sort of look-at-me tactics that one would hope would be beneath a 40-year-old. They're also better reserved for music that doesn't sound like canon-beholden Mojo bait. Watching the videos Newcombe and friends posted to YouTube to accompany a leak of Underground tracks near the end of 2007-- Newcombe spray-painting corny epithets on hallways, Newcombe wrecking and burning all sorts of crap in a forced pique of Keith Moonian splendor, Newcombe getting the word ISLAND tattooed inside his lower lip-- only exacerbates how silly and self-indulgent his half-assed attempts at artistic martyrdom are, and have been. The myth of the Brian Jonestown Massacre-- a construct that holds weight only with the hopelessly converted-- has always superseded and surpassed the actual work of the Brian Jonestown Massacre. Even now, when that myth is but a shadow of its former glory, that still holds true.",2008-05-08T06:00:02,['Rock'],2.6,A,The Brian Jonestown Massacre: My Bloody Underground Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11478-my-bloody-underground/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2008-05-08,-3.4068493150684933,2008.25,0.0
79,The Crawling Distance,['Robert Pollard'],"Robert Pollard and Todd Tobias continue a working relationship that has enjoyed its share of recent successes, most notably 2006's From a Compound Eye and last year's Robert Pollard Is Off to Business.
When Microsoft gawkily rolled out their Songsmith program-- you know, the thing that takes your live vocals and puts silly music behind 'em-- my first thought was of Robert Pollard. Who else but the overgenerous ex-Guided by Voices tunesmith could benefit more from a device that merely needs a vocal melody to cough up a song? Forget the album-a-month pace Pollard's seemingly been keeping these days, with his recent work from his Boston Spaceships, Circus Devils, and his latest solo effort The Crawling Distance; we'd be getting an album-a-day from Bob and his imaginary backing band. Part of me thinks that sort of thing's not so far off for Mr. Pollard already.
Guided by Voices were once a fairly centralized recording concern, but Bob's long been fond of rock-by-correspondence. And he's found quite a pen pal in Todd Tobias, a late-era GBV associate and the strongman to Pollard's bearded lady in the Circus Devils. Pollard and Tobias have been working in this manner for some time now, and the arrangement, I gather, goes like this: Pollard writes the songs, crafts some vocal demos with rudimentary instrumentation, shoots them off to Tobias for fleshing out, and sits around writing the next one while waiting for the results. It's an arrangement with its share of successes-- 2006's From a Compound Eye and last year's Robert Pollard Is Off to Business spring to mind-- but it's also one that's made for some awkward fits; Pollard's the dude responsible for the gloriously crappy-sounding pastiche of Bee Thousand and Propeller, whereas Tobias' workmanlike efforts never sound that far from the backdrop of a ""Dawson's Creek"" episode. Never has that rift between Pollard the songwriter and Tobias the arranger been more transparent-- and more problematic-- than on the formless, often dull The Crawling Distance, a particularly blank batch of Pollard tunes dressed to the nines in Tobias' perfunctory sheen.
Pollard's always best when he's tossed a little grit in the arrangements and kept the song lengths down to a minimum. There are almost certainly some crappy hooks on, say, Guided by Voices' Alien Lanes, but you have a much harder time picking them out when they're buzzing by your head at such a pace. The last several GBV records and Pollard's recent solo work are chock full of songs that approach the five-minute mark, and almost without fail, they tend to plod. So when Crawling Distance kicks off with the characterless piano-led four-minute rocker ""Faking My Harlequin"", it's a stumble the album never quite recovers from. ""Harlequin"" sounds a bit like a modern-era Sonic Youth song before the inevitable noise freakout, but here the tension builds but is never released. Instead, the record moves into the earwormy but stupid swagger of ""Cave Zone"". ""Red Cross Vegas Night"" is nothing more than your standard-issue Pollard-style slow starter-turned-fist pumper, ""The Butler Stands for All of Us"" rides a nice little rolling mod-pop melody and a sneaky guitar line into mediocrity, and the strummy dirge of ""It's Easy""-- though a bit like Mag Earwhig!'s ""I Am Produced"" in tone-- really only has the one thing going for it: the line ""tax exempt with Touchdown Jesus.""
The second half fares a bit better, with the curious circular melody and Sebadoh-like downstrum of ""No Island"" and exciting post-punker ""By Silence Be Destroyed"". Alas, then there's ""Imaginary Queen Anne"", a nice enough slow jam sung with feeling that Pollard could-- and, hell, maybe does-- knock out on trip to the fridge at this point. ""On Shortwave"" is one of those maudlin but intense things Pollard's been brooding over since at least the Universal Truths days. Finally, there's ""Too Much Fun (Is Too Much Fun)"", on which Pollard wastes a killer verse melody with some truly dumbass lyrics then progs up the place at every other point in the song with entirely too much riffage. Hey rockers, wanna end your records on a weird note? Write one about whimsy that is in almost no way enjoyable. Works every time.
Though his vocals are fairly strong throughout, Pollard sounds a bit out of gas while pushing the pen, and these songs by and large aren't much on either structure or substance. But enduring a few lousy Pollard songs in a row is pretty much par for the course for fans of the man these days, so placing the blame for Crawling Distance's failure on Pollard's shoulders would be grossly unfair. It'd all be easier to take if Tobias were doing anything at all interesting with the melodies he's crafting around Bob's tunes. But apart from piling a few extra effects onto the plodding ""Harlequin"", he's giving each and every song its most baseline pop-rock arrangement. Hell, if Tobias is producing most of the stuff Pollard's putting out these days, he's a busy character, and that may go some way to explaining why all these songs were given this unimaginative treatment. And perhaps this is what Pollard wants; more records, more often, with passable sound and enough new tunes to get him through the next all-too-rare tour. But, weak as these tunes appear in their current form, one can't help but wonder how they might've sounded chopped into morsels and fleshed out with a bit more fervor. Or, hell, through Songsmith. Just about anything but how they are right now.",2009-02-06T06:00:02,['Rock'],2.8,"Guided By Voices, Inc.",Robert Pollard: The Crawling Distance Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12637-the-crawling-distance/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2009-02-06,-2.6561643835616437,2009.0,0.0
80,A Star is Born Soundtrack,"['Lady Gaga', 'Bradley Cooper']","At its peaks, the album delivers on the promise of its star-wattage with some of the most affecting and emotionally overwhelming pop songs of the year.
A Star Is Born has no right to be as good as it is. Directed by Bradley Cooper, the third remake of David O. Selznick's 1937 film has been in development for most of the decade and at one point counted Clint Eastwood as its director with, impossibly, Beyoncé in the lead role that Lady Gaga now occupies. The immersive and romantic narrative of singer-songwriter Ally (Gaga) and her relationship with veteran rocker Jackson Maine (Cooper) as the latter watches the former rocket to pop stardom is imbued with the sort of rockism that typically triggers derision in the current cultural climate. But alongside powerful turns from Cooper and Sam Elliott, Gaga shines brightest with an empathetic performance that presents a summation-in-reverse of the last several years of her career.
Since the aggressive blare of 2013's ARTPOP, Gaga has moved further away with every career turn from the brand of pop that put her on the map circa her 2008 debut The Fame; she took up crooning alongside Tony Bennett for 2014's Cheek to Cheek and hopped in the studio with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker and Father John Misty for 2016's Joanne. When the curtain rises on A Star Is Born, she's covering Edith Piaf with fake eyebrows taped on her face; two hours later, she's a full-blown pop star, complete with backup dancers and split-second costume changes. With a wholly organic and real-feeling performance, Gaga again engages in the blur between person and persona that she's toyed with for much of her iconographic career thus far.
Even though Gaga’s performance caps a decade-long run of shapeshifting pop stardom, there’s nothing in the apparently modern-day A Star Is Born that really reflects the actual 2010s pop landscape. For starters, it's a bit difficult to imagine Maine's dyed-in-the-wool country-rock playing to such a huge audience at Coachella, as it does in the film's opening scene; elsewhere, some modern relevance is achieved through a Halsey cameo and a pivotal scene centered around the type of all-star Grammys tribute that typically turns social media into a unanimous airing of grievances. This disconnect from our reality is totally fine: A Star Is Born reaches for and ultimately achieves a timeless vibe that doesn’t require current pop-cultural relevance.
The film’s official soundtrack is similarly old-fashioned in its approach, even as its credits include a host of modern songwriters from the pop, country, and rock spheres. Along with Gaga and Cooper, there’s contributions from Jason Isbell, Willie Nelson’s son Lukas, Mark Ronson, Miike Snow frontman Andrew Wyatt, behind-the-scenes pop wizards Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, the list goes on. The songs fall into a few distinct silos—blaring blues-rockers, tender acoustic ballads, anthemic torch songs, and robotic electro-pop—and save for a digital flourish or two on the pop songs that make up much of the film’s back half, there’s very little here that would’ve sounded out of place on blockbuster film soundtracks of decades past.
At its peaks, the album delivers on the promise of its star-wattage with some of the most affecting and emotionally overwhelming pop songs of the year. If you’ve spent half a day on the internet over the past several weeks, you’ve likely encountered the explosive Gaga-Cooper duet “Shallow,” and deservedly so; it’s a stormy ballad so instantly iconic that its place in Oscar montages for decades to come is practically guaranteed. At the risk of heresy, though, it might not even count as the strongest song on the album—at the least, it reaches a three-way tie with the swaying, unabashedly sentimental “Always Remember Us This Way” and the film’s stunning, heart-wrenching closer, “I’ll Never Love Again.”
Those three standouts heavily feature Gaga—the latter two as solo performances—which speaks to the somewhat uneven nature of the Cooper-led cuts. The simple, sincere, Isbell-penned “Maybe It’s Time” possesses a quiet radiance, but otherwise Cooper’s songs as Maine take on a somewhat anonymous blues-rock shape alongside the soundtrack’s more dynamic moments. Despite the strength of Gaga’s performances captured on this soundtrack—all live takes recorded during filming, an approach that she insisted on—she isn’t totally off the hook when it comes to the lowlights either; the more explicitly pop songs that make up Ally’s ascent as a solo artist range from forgettable (“Heal Me”) to ridiculous (“Why Did You Do That?”).
The mere act of engaging with A Star Is Born's songs in a home-listening setting presents a very modern issue: dialogue or no dialogue? Streaming services currently offer both dialogue-free and dialogue-heavy versions of the soundtrack, the latter functioning as a somewhat spoiler-y but surprisingly immersive experience of the film itself. Choosing which version to stream is a peculiar conundrum to face (imagine, for instance, buying two separate copies of The Bodyguard soundtrack), but even though “I’ll Never Love Again” is plenty effective on its own, the dialogue-included version of the song dramatically cuts out in its final seconds the same way the film does: jumping back in time from Gaga’s time-stopping performance to a pivotal and heartbreaking scene that only enhances the song's emotional quotient.
The switch-up is a nice trick as a listening experience, but it also unintentionally highlights the incidental flaw of A Star Is Born’s soundtrack: It just can’t pack the emotional punch of watching the songs performed within the film. The live recording of “Always Remember Us This Way” doesn’t capture Gaga’s impassioned physical delivery behind the piano, her face emblazoned on a JumboTron behind her as Cooper goes moony-eyed at her blown-up visage. And as powerful as “Shallow” is, nothing matches the look of genuine surprise on Gaga’s face as Ally, when she hits her higher register for the first time and effectively launches the song into the emotional cosmos and beyond. These moments speak to her obvious strengths as a performer, as well as how impressively the music works in congress with the film’s imagery; you can recreate them in your head while listening, or go for your best Gaga while belting these songs out in the shower, but it’s just not as effective as the real thing.",2018-10-09T05:00:00,"['Pop/R&B', 'Folk/Country']",7.4,Interscope,Lady Gaga / Bradley Cooper: A Star is Born Soundtrack Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born-soundtrack/,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018-10-09,7.02054794520548,2018.75,0.0
81,PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO,['PARTYNEXTDOOR'],"Mississauga-born singer and producer Jahron Brathwaite's second album as PARTYNEXTDOOR matches the Drake affiliate's self-assured cockiness with an increased benevolent streak. It functions something like Toronto's answer to ratch&B, replacing the dirtbag charm (or ugliness, as some argue) of someone like Ty Dolla $ign with a more benign disposition.
Last year's self-titled debut from PARTYNEXTDOOR saw the Mississauga-born singer and producer refashion himself as something of a narcotics-fueled lech, a persona that has, in 2014, hardened into an archetype familiar to anyone with a remote interest in R&B over the last half-decade. The beats were shadier than those he sang over when he was making music under his own name, Jahron Brathwaite, and so was his character. ""You got wild bitches telling you lies"" he sang on ""Wild Bitches"", a line so Weeknd-esque that it's kind of shocking Abel Tesfaye didn't get to it first; elsewhere, he boasted of ejaculating on a lover. While his voice sounded great in the dingier digs, the sleaziness felt grafted onto his personality in a way that always felt artificial, and it clashed with his more genuine—and compelling—loverman tendencies.
Brathwaite has scrubbed this occasional creepiness from his sophomore effort, as PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO matches his self-assured cockiness with an increased benevolent streak. He spends the majority of the album in awe of the women he sings about: ""East Liberty"" teems with talk of sunset-watching and proclamations of ""forever""; in less capable hands, a line like ""the ocean's calling your name"" would be an eye-roller, but Brathwaite's puppy-dog earnestness—not to mention the track's woozy, dense throb—prevents it from inducing gag reflexes. Brathwaite does open-minded sincerity much more convincingly than he does charming asshole: ""I want you to turn up every night on me when I see you,"" he urges on the Drake-assisted ""Recognize"" while acknowledging upfront that both he and the woman he's singing to have other lovers. There's a refreshing lack of jealousy and possessiveness on PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO, even as Brathwaite argues that he's in a league far above his competition on almost every song here.
Dropping his defenses helps turn PARTYNEXTDOOR into a project that feels more like Brathwaite's own creation rather than one that primarily (and cynically) reconfigures of-the-moment sounds, but it's still very much a project in perpetual conversation with the rest of today's R&B and rap landscapes. Brathwaite inhabits the same world as his boss, Drake, a place where it's difficult to tell exactly where singing becomes rapping and rapping becomes singing. This time around, he unapologetically swipes Young Thug's higher-and-higher-and-higher delivery and the relentless triplet cadence that Migos has breathed life into, both of which are employed on more than one occasion.
Brathwaite isn't afraid to look into the past, either. He takes Dru Hill's ""Share My World"" and slow-roasts it overnight for the sweltering ""SLS"", and the moment the track finally takes off is one of the album's biggest thrills. ""Muse"" finds PARTYNEXTDOOR submerging Ginuwine's ""Only When Ur Lonely"" in a vat of ink, thickening it up into a viscous sludge. Not all sample choices turn out so well, though—specifically, an egregious sample of Disclosure's ""Latch"" on horndog anthem ""Sex on a Beach"" feels like a play for borrowed interest rather than an inspired recontextualization of a recent hit. Someone will flip ""Latch"" in an intriguing way, it just won't be PARTYNEXTDOOR.
But PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO succeeds, much like its predecessor, largely thanks to Brathwaite's aptitude for mood. His molasses-thick production continues to get weirder in subtle ways; tracks that recall early-'90s R&B suspended in amber (""Grown Woman"") sit next to tracks that sound like they come from an alternate universe where Vangelis has become the go-to producer for decaying bangers. Lyrically, PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO doesn't have its eyes on anything original, and its back half suffers from a turgid sameness that eventually numbs, but Brathwaite's second album functions something like Toronto's answer to ratch&B, replacing the dirtbag charm (or ugliness, as some argue) of someone like Ty Dolla $ign with a more benign disposition.",2014-08-08T06:00:02,['Pop/R&B'],6.8,Warner Bros.,PARTYNEXTDOOR: PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19705-partynextdoor-partynextdoor-two/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2014-08-08,2.847945205479452,2014.5,0.0

The Backstreet Boys. N'Sync. 98 Degrees. LFO. Some of the worst bands that have ever been forced upon the world. And what do they all have in common? They're good-looking Americans. Good-looking, dumb Americans. In such a time of need, who will free us from this prison we have created? Ugly British people. And, if the Bevis Frond's latest offering, Live at the Great American Music Hall, is any indication, judgment day is close at hand.
Nick Saloman (aka the Bevis Frond), whose other credits include founder of Woronzow Records and the Ptolemaic Terrascope zine, is about as close to indie heaven as you can get-- one-man lo-fi pop music made by an actual Englishman. (Bob Pollard can try all he wants to nail that fake-ass British accent, but at the end of the day he's still a drunken hick). Flydaddy Records' website claims that Nick Saloman has been called ""the finest electric guitarist working anywhere right now."" And while that statement is of the same typically overblown nature of most bands' press releases, I'd probably have to agree with that. While Lenny Kravitz wastes his precious career spewing riffs straight out of ""Pentatonic Scales for Chronic Masturbators,"" Saloman constructs flowing, melodic guitar solos that rival those of Guided by Voices/ Gem/ Cobra Verde guitarist Doug Gillard.
Whereas the Frond's two most recent LPs, Vavona Burr and North Circular, have showcased Saloman's ability to write brilliant hook-driven pop songs, Live at the Great American Music Hall showcases the band's bluesier side. Sure, the material on this album lacks the catchiness of other Frond recordings, but Saloman's immensely talented touring band creates an energy and immediacy that is virtually nonexistent on studio outings. See, Saloman is perfectly competent as a bassist and drummer, but the rhythm section on Live-- consisting of Andy Ward on drums and Adrian Shaw on bass-- gives this record a more cohesive sound than any of the Bevis Frond's other albums.
Which brings us back to our original topic: ugly British people. We live in a world where Britney Spears' left tit gets more publicity than every deserving indie act combined. We are living in a world where LFO can sell millions of copies of an album that rhymes ""Hornets"" with ""Sonnets."" Our country is a fucking joke. And as the great ugly British man Winston Churchill once said: ""We have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy.""",1999-10-12T05:00:01,['Rock'],7.5,Flydaddy,"The Bevis Frond: Live at the Great American Music Hall, San Francisco Album Review | Pitchfork",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/684-live-at-the-great-american-music-hall-san-francisco/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1999-10-12,-11.984931506849316,1999.75,0.0

1 / 3 Albums
The Numero Group label applies its careful and thorough approach to the music of 1990s slowcore stalwarts Codeine, with dazzling results.
I started college in the fall of 1991, which means I was old enough to be into underground music, and young enough to be a dick about it. The year punk broke was a couple of years after I'd discovered Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth in high school, and much longer after I'd put on hardcore shows in my dad's backyard as a teenager. I remember a winter meeting at the college radio station toward the start of 1992 where the station director and some other DJs were discussing the success of Nevermind, while I-- wearing a Laughing Hyenas shirt and still smelling like sweat from a Jesus Lizard show the night before-- stood there and shook my head. If I'd been even a year older or younger this would've played out differently. But at that time and place I cared more about Slint's Spiderland, My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, Jesus Lizard's Goat, Dinosaur Jr.'s Green Mind, and Sebadoh III in 1991 than I did Nirvana's game-changer. It's also why I was waiting for the New York slow-core trio Codeine to follow up their excellent 1990 debut, Frigid Stars.
In 1991, I naively thought Codeine were bigger than they actually were. I was in New Jersey, less than an hour from New York City, and traveled to the city (or Maxwell's in Hoboken or a dude's house in Princeton) to catch them whenever I could. A few friends and I even found a way to have our school pay them decently to come out and play in a lifeless student center. For this small group of punks, hardcore kids, indie rockers, and a sensitive metal dude named Adam, Codeine-- along with affiliated bands Bastro, Bitch Magnet, and eventually Seam-- were huge. We were kids into punk, metal, and flat-out noise, and we found something here to tug onto. It was a gateway. In retrospect, it's interesting how heavy all those bands were, when they also had a reputation for delicacy.
The thing people remember most about Codeine is that their music was very, very slow. And the tempo made it even more powerful. Unlike slow-core bands like Low or Red House Painters, Codeine were associated with Slint and the more abrasive Louisville scene, and brought a kind of post-punk dynamic to their music, no matter how fragile it could get. It was glaciers colliding. The band managed to distill everything to these specific, clean, spacious elements. It made sense that their dynamic final album, The White Birch, featured such snowy cover art: Not only did Codeine's music feel like ice, but unrelentingly sad-sack vocalist/bassist Stephen Immerwahr's eyes reminded me of pools of slush, and watching original drummer Chris Brokaw (who left the group after Barely Real to concentrate on his other band, Come) and then powerful final drummer Doug Scharin (Rex, June of 44, HiM) lay down these quarter-speed beats, always looked to me like someone drowning. Their only real overlap on Sub Pop as far as speed was Earth, but Codeine were doing something quite different.
Numero's new deluxe reissuing of the New York trio's three major releases are long overdue, both as a reminder and a history lesson. The overall collection's been remastered and titled When I See the Sun, something Codeine did not do very often. The label did a great job with the set: 1990's Frigid Stars, 1992's Barely Real EP, and 1994's The White Birch are available here as three double LPs that come with CDs of the same material. Each is packed with Peel Sessions, live and alternate takes, demos, compilation tracks, and B-sides. The albums all include extensive liner notes and essays by important voices from that period like the New York guitarist Alan Licht and Chemical Imbalance's Mike McGonigal (also a Pitchfork contributor), along with distilled oral histories.
Codeine opened their first record with a song called ""D"" and the words, ""D for effort/ D for intent/ D because you pay the rent/ D for love/ D for insight."" And their work doesn't get much more cheerful after that. But Immerwahr sings those lines and the almost uplifting chorus (""I want you to need me/ Not to feed me"") with a gentle grace, fleshed out by guitarist John Engle's simple, spacious chords, and Brokaw's equally open drumming. They didn't change their sound much across their three official releases: Frigid Stars was the most surprising because it was the first, and when the six-song Barely Real EP emerged a couple of years later, it felt masterful in its compression of what we'd come to expect from them. By the time they got to The White Birch, their most Slint-like moment, they were adding a few more wrinkles, like bigger, more melodic guitars (as typified on the gigantic, nautical-themed opener ""Sea""), and Scharin could play even slower and heavier than Brokaw. But the music was just as focused on the original set of concerns.
The group was so good at paring down their music that a number of the bonuses that appear on these sets, while fun, serve mostly to show you that Immerwahr and co. included the right material on their records and had a good feel for the correct tempos and aesthetics. I liked hearing the almost black-metal feedback of the demo for Frigid Stars' ""Second Chance"" and the fuzzed-out, backward-guitar of the ""Cave-In"" demo (yes, the Boston band got their name from that one), but the originals are miles beyond these curiosities. That said, some non-album tracks call for repeat listens, like the gentle, warm ""Summer Dresses"", the B-side live staple ""Broken Hearted Wine"", and an acoustic take on ""Pea"", the final track on Frigid Stars as well as the B-side to a split with Bitch Magnet.
There are also covers: slow-core takes on Joy Division's ""Atmosphere"" and Unrest's ""Hydroplane"". Neither of these is surprsing; the group's interests and affliliations weren't difficult to track down. Frigid Stars' ""New Year's"" was co-written with Bitch Magnet's Sooyoung Park and later recorded with his gentler post-Bitch Magnet band, Seam. David Grubbs played the solo piano on ""W"", a track on Barely Real, and showed up again as a guitarist for The White Birch's ""Tom"" and ""Wird"" (a reworking of the earlier ""W""). Bitch Magnet's Jon Fine added ""noisy guitar"" to Barely Real's ""Jr."", and the EP ended with a cover of MX-80 Sound's ""Promise of Love"" (in 1992, I admittedly thought it was a Codeine original). They thanked ""Louisville"" in the liner notes for The White Birch.
As important as Codeine were to me personally, and as influential as they were on the scene at that time, and on bands after (Mogwai, Low), they're a group many don't seem to remember. Maybe because Immerwahr, always the face for the band, basically dropped out of music after he ran out of ideas for Codeine (he now works as a research scientist). But there's something especially fascinating about how people rewrite or misremember history. When I see folks in their 20s writing about the music of the 90s, they often get the little things wrong, or are writing about one-person's interpretation as though that's how it was. It makes sense that the smaller details would slip through the cracks. And while I admit it's hard separating my personal history from Codeine, the group's output really does stand up; they were more important in the early 90s than most people realize today, and maybe that will change here.",2012-06-28T06:00:00,['Rock'],8.8,Numero Group,Codeine: Frigid Stars / Barely Real EP / The White Birch Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16766-frigid-stars-barely-real-ep-the-white-birch/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2012-06-28,0.7356164383561644,2012.25,0.0
84,El Camino,['The Black Keys'],"The Black Keys' seventh album features Danger Mouse's strongest production work for the group and a mood that's frivolous, fun, and unabashedly corny.
It behooves us to take 90 seconds here and figure out how this band got so popular and enduring. The Black Keys were born in the teeth of the early-aughts ""Rock Is Back!"" movement, wherein a cadre of uncouth garage-y bands all named The ______s saved us from the terrorists and/or the Backstreet Boys. Eventual result: deserved ignominy (the Vines), undeserved ignominy (the Hives), bewildered near-implosion (the Strokes), and bewildering total implosion (the White Stripes). The years have not been kind.
You didn't figure the Keys as sole survivors and mainstream lifers when The Big Come Up emerged in 2002 and offered a walking rockist orgasm: two gawky white dudes from Akron, Ohio, drums and surly guitar and burning-oatmeal-mouthed yawps of not terribly articulate romantic frustration, all powering cartoonishly virile garage-blues jams of prison-phone-call fidelity and sentiment. Ridiculous and kind of awesome. (This assumes racially uneasy cultural appropriation is no longer an issue for you, but if so, feel free to evoke the Blueshammer scene in the Ghost World movie and the hell with it.)
And so. They named their second album Thickfreakness; they recorded their third album in an abandoned tire factory and named it Rubber Factory. For a while there, they always did confoundingly well in critics' polls, as though they were every single rock scribe's seventh-favorite band. They evolved incredibly slowly-- you can enjoy their early work tremendously and never retain five consecutive seconds of it beyond their cover of ""Have Love Will Travel"". Danger Mouse got involved as a producer, to the immediately evident benefit of no one. Coupla daffy side projects in there somewhere. (BlakRoc!) Ah yes, and they got their music in a shitload of ads, from Victoria's Secret to Zales to American Express to Subaru, like just so much capitalism, to the extent that they went on The Colbert Report with Vampire Weekend and clowned themselves about it.
By which time they'd broken through. Last year's Brothers, their sixth album, had wit and pop charm and a minor hit in ""Tighten Up"" (and unremitting bloat, but ah), and thus came the Spin cover, the Saturday Night Live appearances, the Grammys. And now we greet El Camino, their best and (not coincidentally) goofiest album, a veritable frat-worthy ""Pimp 'n' Ho"" party in which T. Rex has somehow been tricked into serving as house band. The riffs are glam-nasty, the lyrics sublimely knuckleheaded, the basslines nimble and bombastic, the mood frivolous and fun and unabashedly corny. It's way shorter than Brothers, too. Sweet cars, witchy women, ""Gold on the Ceiling."" A bizarre attempt to philosophically combine the videos for ""Sabotage"" and ""Legs"". The fine line between a tricked-out GTO and ""GTFO.""
Danger Mouse figured it out, for one thing. He unnecessarily arted up 2008's Attack & Release (plus the hit off Brothers), and his angelic-choir/space-glockenspiel Super Mario Galaxy fantasias still distract-- everything's a goddamn spaghetti western with this guy. But Camino's sonic frills are mercifully few, content to stick your head right in Patrick Carney's bass drum as he stomps through the caveman jam ""Hell of a Season"" with virtuosic anti-virtuosity, or revel in the machine-gun surge of Dan Auerbach's gong-banging guitar on surging opener ""Lonely Boy"". It's a shame Rock Band is no longer a thing. ""Gold on the Ceiling"" is just filthy, like George Thorogood scoring porn, all raunchy organ and licentious handclaps and chorus help from ladies attempting to sound like the sorts of ladies Steely Dan loved to write songs about. ""I wanna buy some time/ But don't have a dime,"" goes the raucous one called ""Money Maker"". Better cash some Subaru checks.
The lyrics! The lyrics are hilarious. Great advice, via Brothers: ""Well, you can watch her strut/ But keep your mouth shut."" God bless Auerbach for ignoring it, and, amid the keening/crunching stomp of ""Run Right Back"", dropping some serious knowledge: ""Well she's a special thing/ She doesn't read too much, oh/ But there's no doubt/ She's written about."" Which is really just a prelude to the miraculous five-word sequence that is ""Finest exterior/ She's so superior,"" which, Jesus. Show me the CARFAX, Romeo. Your emotional climax is ""Little Black Submarines"", which starts acoustic and pathos-ridden: ""A broken heart is blind,"" goes the biologically suspect refrain. But then, hosanna, the distortion kicks in, the riff from ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" is lifted wholesale, and suddenly we are rocking, Carney and Auerbach in call-and-response/attack-and-release napalm mode, back in the rubber factory in spirit if not tax bracket.
Yes, well. Consider El Camino the aural equivalent of one of those Chrysler ""Imported from Detroit"" ads where a $47,000 car slowly rolls through one of the most devastated cities in America, a sign for 8 Mile Road glimpsed through tinted windows: the finest in luxury grit. Seedy, escapist camp, crass but expert, so expert. That they're the true victors of the 2000s garage explosion is no shock at all. Rock came back.

85,The Complete Atlantic Singles 1968-1971,['Dusty Springfield'],"Featuring most the magisterial Dusty in Memphis and its lesser follow-up A Brand New Me, plus a bevy of related tracks, a new collection captures one of pop’s most fascinating personalities in her second act.
By 1968, Dusty Springfield had begun to suspect that there was no easy way down. Cool enough to duet with Jimi Hendrix on her regrettably named ITV show It Must Be Dusty but hobbled by increasingly dowdy material, Springfield realized it wasn’t a good time for singers with bouffant hairstyles who hoped to stay hip. Signing with Atlantic and relocating to Memphis that year looked like a smart move, resulting in a body of work as substantial as Aretha Franklin’s own Atlantic recordings. The Complete Atlantic Singles 1968-1971 collects most of the magisterial Dusty in Memphis (1969), its lesser follow-up A Brand New Me (1970), and a bevy of tracks orbiting the albums like lonely satellites.
Before turning to this fecund epoch, it’s important to appreciate Springfield’s achievements. To savor the run of singles recorded between 1963 and 1967, from “I Only Want to Be With You” to “The Look of Love” means appreciating Springfield’s combination of winsomeness and submersion; unlike Dionne Warwick, another beneficiary of Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s compositions, Springfield wasn’t detached, as her performance of the 1966 Pino Donaggio and Vito Pallavicini composition “You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me,” rewritten in English, testifies. But Springfield, who wrote a song here and there and exerted more production control than credits aver, had grown restless. She insisted on working with the redoubtable producer Jerry Wexler. The eight songs he brought to what became Dusty in Memphis represented the best of the so-called Brill Building songwriters: Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. Randy Newman and Michel Legrand chipped in too. With Arif Mardin and engineer Tom Dowd joining Wexler, the venture had promise.
A combination of Springfield’s mild anxiety about singing live with a rhythm section and her insistence on controlling the material stalled the project at first. “To say yes to one song was seen as a lifetime commitment,” Wexler carped later. Most of the vocals she eventually recorded in New York, a development with no bearing on the album’s swampy, undulating sonics: Dusty was in the fantasy-selling business. Aretha had already rejected a John Hurley-Ronnie Wilkins soul number called “Son of a Preacher Man.” Time and impatience with the Pulp Fiction mythos hasn’t dulled Springfield’s signature tune, in which she sasses and upbraids one “Billy” while an ebullient horn section blows its support and bassist Tommy Cogbill plucks the sweetest line she’d ever sung over. So self-assured was Springfield’s performance that Franklin recorded a version for This Girl’s in Love with You (1970)—and it’s merely decent (Springfield and Annie Lennox remain the only women to have gone eye-to-eye with Franklin and survived).
Bifurcating erotic abandon and a melancholy as permanent as soul death, the rest of Dusty in Memphis depends on the intuitiveness with which the players and the singer understand their respective needs: Springfield’s for ballast, house band the Memphis Boys for ethereality. It’s not a concept album as such but it often unfolds like one: Dusty Springfield recreating herself as lover and loved, essaying her stylized version of soul music. “It is a love that is all at once diffuse, dark, unpredictable, ecstatic, and a terrible deal,” Warren Zane speculated in his 33 1/3 book on the album. This sparkling remix underscores the achievements: the oboe in “I Don’t Want to Hear It Anymore” circling her mediations like a long-legged fly; Reggie Young’s forlorn guitar arpeggio in “Just One Smile” and—it was 1968—his sitar in “In the Land of Make Believe.” Singers dependent on an upper register risk tiring listeners with their intensity; with Springfield, the syllable-at-a-time approach noted by future producer Neil Tennant, torturous to her current record makers, transforms her into a co-creator. Tangling the sensual and the threatening, she masters assonance (“br-eh-kfast in b-ehhh-d”), discretion (quietly breathy in the verses of “Don’t Forget About Me” as if afraid of wearing out a welcome), timing (a full stop for each word in the chorus of “No Easy Way Down”).
A Brand New Me steps away from the brink. Relocating from Memphis to Philadelphia with songwriter-producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, Springfield doesn’t inhabit the material: she externalizes it. The album is soft-focus, blurry. Gamble and Huff approach her as if circling a runway. Sweet banalities like “Bad Case of the Blues” unfurl alongside gutbucket funk pop like “Lost.” The title track, her last American Top 40 hit until 1988, is a manifesto in search of a cause. The mildly bossa nova-flavored “Let Me in Your Way” works best: Springfield follows bassist Ronnie Baker’s melody. For a hint of what could’ve been, look to the bonus material collected on the anthology, most of which has found homes on reissues of the studio albums over the years: “Haunted,” graced with swampy organ lick, and a momentum similar to Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere to Run”; the way in which “Someone Who Cares” switches from cocktail ballad despondency to I’m-here-to-tell-ya euphoria; and “Willie and Laura Mae Jones,” a sharecropper-era fantasia by Tony Joe White in which the cotton is high and the corn is growin’ fine.
One part of that tale rings true: lots of corn, fine and high, on the last half of this compilation—itself redundant, for remastered and expanded versions of both albums have existed for years. Yet Dusty Springfield remains one of pop’s most fascinating, protean personalities. Not just a British woman singing R&B but a queer British woman, she dwelled in a sinister twilight where objects of desire bobbed gender-fluid but no less distracting. She was the poet of the afterglow. The 1970s she spent doing TV theme material and backing vocals for buddies like Elton John; after the collapse of her relationship with erstwhile collaborator Norma Tanega, she was scared about British tabloids outing her. She waited a pop eternity for Tennant and Chris Lowe, aglow with childhood memories of her and Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw, to give her sympathetic arrangements again. Like Gladys Knight and her Pips, Springfield needed backtalking backup singers and horn blasts after breakfast in bed. The Complete Atlantic Singles is the un-easiest of listening. Thank Dusty Springfield.

86,Negro Swan,['Blood Orange'],"Dev Hynes’ fourth album as Blood Orange focuses on black depression, sketching his anxious alt-pop, progressive R&B, indie hip-hop, downtempo rock, and spacey chillwave into a minimalist emulsion.
In his captivating book Black Swan Lake: Life of a Wetland, Australian scholar Rod Giblett traces a cultural history of the slender, waterborne bird. Black swans have long been prized by indigenous communities for their exotic, improbable beauty. European colonizers, however, tended to malign the birds as evil, ugly, and unwelcome, simply due to their color. Delicate and fierce, fetishized and rebuked, black swans live at the intersections: they’re both/and, more than one given thing at any given time.
On his fourth studio album as Blood Orange, musical polymath Devonté Hynes explores the comforts and complications of living a life as both/and—of being treated, to borrow from Thelonious Monk, as an ugly beauty. Negro Swan captures the scattershot, jittery, anxious, blissed-out-depressive feeling of what it’s like to be a marginalized person at a toxic and retrograde moment in global culture and politics. “No one wants to be the Negro Swan,” he laments on “Charcoal Baby.” “No one wants to be the odd one out at times…/Can you break sometimes?” Hynes goes for the anachronistic “Negro” to suggest the history of racial abjection—just like the phrase “Charcoal Baby” evokes 19th-century blackface performers who used burnt cork, or charcoal, to darken their faces for white audiences. The album’s cover photo, shot by the designer-photographer Ana Kraš, drives home the ugly beauty idea: A black man perches on a car windowpane, rocking a white, studded do-rag, eyeshadow, and wings on his back.
Negro Swan’s world-weary opening track “Orlando” offers a 21st-century update on those tragic politics of deflation and depletion. Hynes’ production goes for pretty, sprightly textures: sampled street sounds, twinkling electric piano, chicken-cluck wah-wah guitar, and a mid-tempo funky shuffle beat. As if to alert us to sudden danger, a dancehall-style alarm goes off (alarms are a recurring motif on the album). Sounding like a quivering Curtis Mayfield, Hynes falsetto-croons the hook, “First kiss was the floor,” a blood-chilling reflection about being bullied/bashed as a child on a school bus.
Like most of the tracks on Negro Swan, “Orlando” isn’t content to be just one thing. As the hook arrives, the song abruptly morphs into a pensive guitar vamp, and we’re treated to an interlude with trans activist Janet Mock, riffing about the value of “doing too much” in a culture that doesn’t allow marginalized people to truly excel at much of anything. Mock shows up on five of Negro Swan’s 16 tracks: Fly-on-the-wall interludes constituted from bits of their recorded conversations, Mock’s spoken-word commentaries provide a voice-of-wisdom presence throughout. They also confirm the album’s central conceit: how people of color and queers manage trauma in a racist, heteronormative culture, even as we pursue alternative models of kinship that ensure our liberation.
Hynes has said that Negro Swan is about black depression as well as his own tumultuous childhood in England. Besides “Orlando,” glum, detuned “Dagenham Dream” also explores the ins and outs of his earliest memories (the title refers to a scrappy neighborhood in East London); and on foreboding ""Nappy Wonder,” featuring cellist and singer Kelsey Lu, Hynes reminisces about former days in Barking (another East London town) over doodling piano, reversed guitar riffs, and drum and bass that irregularly drop in and out of the track. Fusing together alt-pop, progressive R&B, indie hip-hop, downtempo rock, and spacey chillwave into a minimalist emulsion, Negro Swan can be jumpy and hard to pin down. You get the sense that Hynes would have it no other way.
In fact, Hynes’ entire career (oscillating between bands, solo ventures, aliases, side projects, auteur experimentalism, work-for-hire pop, etc.) has been about multiplicity and blurring categorizations. His last release, 2016’s Freetown Sound, ventured far afield, musing on his immigrant parents’ lives and merging political activism with melancholia for late 1980s queer NYC life. Hynes has long made good as an in-demand alternative pop producer for starlets like Carly Rae Jepsen and Solange; and more recently, he’s had unexpected collaborations with A$AP Rocky, Girlpool, and Philip Glass. Negro Swan’s unpredictable guest list is a testament to Hynes’ curatorial savvy: The album features Chairlift’s Caroline Polachek, Colombian-Canadian vocalist Tei Shi, NYC vocalist Ian Isiah, alt-soul singer Georgia Anne Muldrow, actress Amandla Stenberg, as well Kindness’ Adam Bainbridge, Diana Gordon, and others.
Though multi-instrumentalist producers are often lone-wolf figures, Hynes’ collaborative spirit confirms that he’s most interested in a communal “we” approach to making music. He also strives for a similar pluralism in his approach to gender. In the seven years since he first appeared under the Blood Orange alias, non-normative Hynes (who identifies as not gay, but not straight) pushes back against machismo and male power in an effort to diversify stylistic representations of black masculinity. In fact, he might be the key figure connecting the black polymath template (think of other Renaissance men like Smokey Robinson, Babyface, Pharrell Williams, Tyler, the Creator, etc.) to contemporary identity struggles around sexual fluidity and anti-racism. Negro Swan’s insistence on the politics of indeterminate identity especially resonates against the backdrop of a 2018 MAGA political climate in which collective anxieties—impacted by political and economic insecurity and public officials’ gaslighting tactics—have gone through the roof.
Despite its thematic focus on anxiety—or maybe because of it—Negro Swan is a drifty, loose, dissociated affair. Adrenaline-pounding dance beats like the ones found on Freetown Sound’s propulsive “Best to You” or “E.V.P.” don’t show up here. Instead, the album sounds more like a downcast mixtape constituted from helter-skelter sounds, sketched-out musical ideas, and conversation fragments. (Hynes has described his aesthetic as open tabs on a browser; that is certainly the case here). Ambient, blunted “Vulture Baby” taps into a vintage psychedelic soul sound; but at only one minute and 15 seconds, it’s here and gone. “Chewing Gum” centers on a languorous ’80s pop melody and a chugging hip-hop beat before turning the spotlight to A$AP Rocky and Memphis’ Project Pat rapping about pussy and dick. Negro Swan’s cauldron of abstract soundscapes, melancholic drift, and disjointed musical ideas will frustrate those looking for more structured pop, and it will enliven others who can respect the slapdash, bricolage aesthetic as a key element in Hynes’ creative master plan.
Hynes always racks up realness points for not being afraid to come off uncool. His skittish singing doesn’t have a lot of power, but its gawky delicateness feels modest and palpably intimate. Negro Swan leans on inspirational, self-help messages—standing in your truth, coming out of darkness into light—that could have come off as mawkish or gauche in lesser hands. “Holy Will,” one of the album’s left-curve highlights, happens to be a winning, deconstructed take on the Clark Sisters’ gospel “Center of Thy Will.” And album closer “Smoke” centers around a lyric—“The sun comes in/My heart fulfills within”—that makes Negro Swan a far less pessimistic affair than much of the bleak R&B that’s ruled the airwaves and streaming services for the last decade. For a project focused on fragility that asks the question, “Can you break sometimes?” the album closes on a blissful note that dreams of wholeness.
Slippery and cryptic, Negro Swan blurs boundaries between the finished and the unfinished; between focused deliberation and thrown-together spontaneity; between fly-on-the-wall conversations and self-contained songs; between indie experimentalism and overground pop; between insider and outsider, black and white, straight and gay, trans and cis; between taxing depletion and invigorating replenishment. Dev Hynes remains an unfettered black man making whatever the fuck music comes into his head. Given that his artistic ideas affirm the power of community, kinship, and therapeutic healing in the midst of grim, dark times, his adventures in musical freedom remain a sublime political act.",2018-08-24T05:00:00,['Pop/R&B'],7.6,Domino,Blood Orange: Negro Swan Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blood-orange-negro-swan/,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018-08-24,6.894520547945206,2018.5,0.0
87,LongLiveA$AP,['A$AP Rocky'],"Best new music
A few months ago, A$AP Rocky's career seemed mired in purgatory as his major label debut continued to be pushed back. But LongLiveA$AP actually delivers on and even exceeds the promise of 2011's LiveLoveA$AP mixtape, preserving Rocky's immaculate taste while smartly upgrading his sound.
A few months ago, A$AP Rocky's career seemed mired in purgatory. The 24-year-old Harlem rapper had a spectacular 2011, snagging a still-crazy $3 million deal with RCA based on early buzz and then silencing skeptics with his breakout LiveLoveA$AP mixtape. But throughout 2012, LongLiveA$AP repeatedly failed to materialize. It was slated for July 4th, then September 11th, October 31, and eventually, sometime in December. When the final pushback happened, into the dead zone just after the new year, it began to feel like RCA was attempting to quietly jettison their investment from the corporate hull.
But LongLiveA$AP delivers on and even exceeds the promise of LiveLoveA$AP. Like that mixtape, the album is a triumph of craft and curation, preserving Rocky's immaculate taste while smartly upgrading his sound. A third of the record remains close in style to LiveLoveA$AP while most of the collaborations follow in the steps of last spring's ""Goldie"", which stamped producer Hit-Boy's signature Mini-Boss Musik with a screwed-up hook and gumball-spitting flow that marked it as unmistakably Rocky's. Plenty of rap-industry heavies appear on LongLiveA$AP, and they mix well with Rocky's younger comrades. More importantly, the French-braid gold-teeth kid named after Rakim never cedes the center. For someone often criticized for his lack of depth, A$AP Rocky keeps delivering in the face of skepticism.
Even the most dubious ideas succeed on LongLiveA$AP. For example, A$AP Rocky's team-up with Skrillex, ""Wild for the Night"", bombs your cortex with screaming lasers, stadium-sized reverb, and a reggae-derived organ lope, and the beat feels like being on the receiving end of a perfectly executed Tekken chain combo. It seems like it should be impossible to rap over, but Rocky’s sweat-free double-dutch is an easy fit. Santigold handles the chorus hook on “Hell”, one of two Clams Casino beats on the album, and it feels just as unforced.
A$AP Rocky sounds natural in every setting; along with his command of rhythm and cadence, this is his greatest gift. Whether he's showing off double- and triple-time bounce in the T-Minus-produced ""PMW (All I Really Need)"" or dodging RZA-styled string chops on ""1 Train"" alongside a collision of hot rappers including Action Bronson, Big K.R.I.T., and Kendrick Lamar, Rocky sounds utterly at home. Even when he stomps through a queasy Odd Future-style battlefield on “Jodye”, he fully owns the mold. That kind of malleability is crucial to pop stardom, and make no mistake, pop stardom is what Rocky's gunning for. His lyrics, a riot of lifestyle brands and other desirables, can feel like standing in front of a closet of prohibitively expensive designer goods: There isn't much to feel unless you consider ""like three million bucks"" a feeling. But besides the Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors, the Margielas with no laces, the Escada and Balenciaga and Audemars Piguet, there's a lot going on in Rocky's head.
Late-album track ""Suddenly"" bears a co-producing credit from ""Lord Flacko,"" aka Rocky himself. In it, a drumless vocal sample fights its way to the surface through layers of aquatic muffling, teasing a titanic beat-drop that keeps not arriving. The song is almost all intro: When the beat finally hits, it only lingers for a few bars before disappearing again. Over this master class in tension and release, Rocky summons childhood memories in calm, expansive strokes: ""Everybody have roaches, but our roaches ain't respect us,"" he cracks, flashing a previously unseen storytelling flair: ""We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights/ And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds/ In one clip, left two down, that's four kids/ But one lived, left three dead but one split/ That one missed, that one snitched."" The song is a forceful reminder of his birthplace and heritage.
Rocky’s New York story has partly been a story of how there is no coherent New York story anymore: Bay Area rappers like the Jacka convincingly channel the gray Queensbridge fatalism of Mobb Deep and Cormega while in Harlem, Rocky soaked up styles happening hundreds of miles away-- Houston screw music, UGK, Bone Thugs. But beneath the 90s-baby trappings, Rocky is a certain breed of Harlem rapper incarnate-- flashy, ambitious, and affably determined to cross over. The flamboyance and singsong rhyme patterns of the Diplomats are an obvious primary color. But reaching further back, to another Harlemite with a deceptively catchy flow, agreeable air, and penchant for colorful clothing, and you find another kindred spirit in Ma$e. Like Ma$e, Rocky tucks steely edges behind a goofy smile. He has the same unerring instinct for balancing pop smarts and street edge and a similar disregard for New York orthodoxy. He’s also consistently dismissed as a lightweight. It's true, Rocky may not be the answer to New York rap's savior complex. But he is undeniably a hit-maker and a major new rap star for a city that sorely needs one. And with LongLiveA$AP, he's beaten expectations twice.",2013-01-02T06:00:00,['Rap'],8.5,Polo Grounds / RCA,A$AP Rocky: LongLiveA$AP Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17505-longliveaap/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2013-01-02,1.2506849315068493,2013.0,0.0
88,Long Term Effects of SUFFERING,['$uicideboy$'],"Channeling the stark sound and fatalistic worldview of vintage Southern rap, the New Orleans duo takes grim pleasure in grappling with substance abuse and mental illness.
Of the many rappers who followed the aesthetic formula laid out by SpaceGhostPurrp and Raider Klan—lo-fi samples, hotboxed ’90s nostalgia, and an atmosphere that evokes witch house as much as horrorcore—few have built as stable a career as $uicideboy$, the New Orleans-born cousins Ruby da Cherry and $crim. With no radio hits and little in the way of mainstream American press, the duo has amassed a substantial following, to the tune of hundreds of millions of streams and collaborations with Travis Barker and Korn’s Munky. As their status has grown, so has their focus, and their once prolific release schedule has slowed. Their work hinges on a central question: When you’ve defined yourself by a professed desire to die, how do you sustain a thriving career based on your trauma? Long Term Effects of SUFFERING makes it clear that the anguish is no gimmick, but rather part of an almost Zen philosophy: For $uicideboy$, all of life is suffering, and it’s in that suffering that their work finds its meaning.
Ruby and $crim, who are both in their thirties, are older than most of their artistic peers. At the age that Lil Peep or XXXTentacion were dealing with sudden fame, Ruby and $crim were broke and trying to get their shit together, which might be why their music is so effectively cathartic: Though they often rap about celebrity, they have experienced what it’s like to be an adult without any kind of success, not just fighting the demons in your head but struggling, in a very real, material way, to survive.
Ruby spent his teen years playing in punk bands, and both cousins grew up under the influence of the local Cash Money, but they were drawn to different kinds of rap music as they grew older, a binary that’s fairly evident in their music: Ruby stuck to the classics, crediting more lyrically driven artists from Wu-Tang to Souls of Mischief as touchstones, while $crim fell in love with the head-banging hi-hats and gun sounds of Waka Flocka and Chief Keef. Their first mixtapes, adorned with memes like R. Buddy Dwyer’s on-air suicide or Bill Clinton playing the saxophone, feel almost more like the blunted blog rap of Big K.R.I.T. or Jackie Chain, just delivered in a slower drawl, with archetypal boasts about cocaine bumps, hit-and-runs, and hook-ups. Across subsequent releases, the flows sharpened, the production grew more composed, and the subject matter took on a more personal focus. $crim has been particularly vocal about his struggles with opioid addiction and substance abuse, and on Long Term Effects of SUFFERING, the group’s past tapestries of violence have given way to more genuinely felt songs like “Life Is but a Stream~,” which tearfully expresses how the side effects of addiction can drive away the people you love.
$uicideboy$ are more than capable of straight-up buck-wild tracks like “WE ENVY NOTHING IN THE WORLD.,” essentially a disconnected series of nihilistic images of extreme violence. But the duality in their work also allows space for positivity. Pain brings with it the possibility of healing, and on “The Number You Have Dialed Is Not in Service,” they offer wary words of encouragement to the desperate, despite the song’s punchline: When $crim, feeling suicidal, calls his therapist, the only answer is a dead-end intercept message. Suicidal thoughts are a constant presence on Long Term Effects of SUFFERING, and their bars are filled with images of psych wards and alienation. But despite their hardcore reputation and fatalistic lyrics, the pair effortlessly ease into lighter modes: “Smile at my casket/I’m at peace with my death,” croons $crim on “Forget It,” over a syrupy beat of almost Drain Gang-like trance pop.
$uicideboy$ are enthusiastic sample flippers who regularly return to the well of classic Memphis rap for sonic inspiration, but it’s no longer just imitation; they’ve grown confident and skilled enough to break out of the confines of their established sound. There are obvious Southern rap vocal samples across songs like “Degeneration in the Key of a Minor” and “Avalon,” but more left-field flips as well, like the subtle interpolation of the Counts’ “Love Sign” on “Lighting the Flames of My Own Personal Hell.” Over time, their beats have grown from simpler drum patterns stitched to Southern rap samples into more fully realized constructions, as likely to throw in a fluttering jazz sax or subtle xylophone as a trap hi-hat.
More than any of the usual names that get trotted out when discussing SoundCloud rap or emo rap, $uicideboy$ share the most with Lil Ugly Mane, who they’ve been known to sample. Both artists take vintage Southern rap as a kind of foundational pastiche but shape it into a found-sound collage of esoteric and experimental influences, finding a parallel between the violence of Southern rap and the often physically violent form that mental illness can take. When $uicideboy$ most deliberately ape the scary movie sounds of Memphis rap, like on “If Self-Destruction Was an Olympic Event, I’d Be Tanya Harding,” it’s mostly to create a sense of discomfort and unease. On “Materialism as a Means to an End,” the bass ricochets back and forth between the right and left speakers, making for a banger that feels like it’s mid-nervous breakdown.
As with Lil Ugly Mane, and any white artist who borrows so liberally and obviously from Black music, there’s a very real question of appropriation to chew on, especially considering the legal action Three 6 Mafia took against the duo over uncleared samples. But $uicideboy$ aren’t just pilfering rap history: The group has also come under fire for sampling deadmau5 without clearance and regularly flip contemporary artists like Denzel Curry, Lana Del Rey, and even themselves. They frequently sound less like a Southern rap tribute act than a dizzying pastiche of pastiches.
Though their music has often been described as “horrorcore,” they have flatly rejected that label. There are no concept songs from the point of view of Chucky here, no absurd gore, no John Carpenter flips. Three 6 Mafia used the imagery of slashers and demonic possession to express their condition as inhabitants of a society in which they had little to no power over their lives due to racial and economic oppression. $uicideboy$ are similarly unsparing in their reminder that, for many Americans, reality is shaped by violent and destructive forces beyond our control.
Substance abuse and its material causes are the ghosts in the rafters of modern rap, but $uicideboy$ invite them into the blunt rotation, directly confronting the pain that haunts so much of the genre. Detractors have claimed that artists like $uicideboy$, like so many rappers and rock stars before their time, as well as so many of their creative peers, glamorize mental illness and addiction. Every generation tends to believe that history will end, or at least peak, with its passing, but SoundCloud rap—or emo rap, or whatever you want to call it—and its audience belong to an era when our fate seems scientifically sealed. Faced with that grim prognosis, $uicideboy$ ask: What’s wrong with taking a little pleasure in your own demise when it’s all but set in stone?

89,Écailles de Lune,['Alcest'],"French artist Neige finally fits all his component parts-- arching atmospherics, celestial melodies, suffocating roars-- into one dynamic metal record.
Écailles de Lune, the second LP from romantic black metallurgists Alcest, is the most fully realized effort to date from its frontman and lone constant Neige. The spindly Frenchman has been a member of a half-dozen bands, from the brittle Peste Noire to the wildly and willfully diverse coed quartet Amesoeurs. Since 2005, Neige has been releasing music as Alcest that ranges from the black metal of 2005 EP Le Secret to the Red House Painters-via-Justin Broadrick 2007 LP, Souvenirs d'un Autre Monde. Now, he's finally fit all of his component parts-- arching atmospherics, celestial melodies, suffocating roars-- into one record. At last, Neige has made an album that plays like one.
At a time when both legitimately heavy bands like Wolves in the Throne Room and Liturgy and electronic acts like Ben Frost and Fuck Buttons are using black metal ideas to build something bigger, Neige lands one of the most cohesive, well-considered experiments yet. He peels apart the layers of black metal-- lacerated vocals, relentless rhythms, overtone-rich guitars-- and applies them to disparate structures and sounds.
On ""Percées de Lumière"", the rhythm supplies a pace that's nearly krautrock, while the guitars revolve around a minor riff that suggests Slint. So, of course, the metal shifts to the vocals. Neige generally sings gracefully and carefully, but here he screams in black-metal horror. ""Écailles de Lune [Part I]"", on the other hand, even sounds like a toughened mix of M83 and Sigur Rós, with guitars saturating every space and Neige's voice floating like Jónsi Birgisson's once did. Beneath the surface, however, the militant pacing of drummer Winterhalter and the increasingly sinister note selections of Neige presage something heavier. For the final two minutes, they rage like Scandinavian lords in a high-dollar studio. Thanks to the methodical if subtle way that song develops, moving from staggering rock to twinkling atmospherics to something altogether more intense, it doesn't seem out of place. The same holds for ""Part II"", which erupts quickly into a brutal rush only to burn itself out, dissolving into a ghastly drone that builds and collapses twice more. The line between the tormented and the gorgeous blurs into an imagined boundary-- tedious to find, delightful to miss.
Several reviews of Écailles de Lune have criticized the album's brevity, noting that, though its six tracks clock in just shy of 42 minutes, ""Percées de Lumière"" appeared on a limited-edition split last year, while the 108-second instrumental, ""Abysses"", doesn't warrant mention as a ""song."" That's an unfortunate dismissal, especially because ""Abysses"" is as vital as anything else here. Like the best of Alcest's output, it's a ghastly but beautiful hum. Neither an admonition nor an invitation, neither noise nor new age, it confirms the newfound patience and purpose of Neige, who's made an album that's more enchanting than even these last few years of promise have suggested.",2010-04-29T06:00:02,"['Metal', 'Rock']",8.4,Prophecy,Alcest: Écailles de Lune Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14164-ecailles-de-lune/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2010-04-29,-1.4315068493150684,2010.25,0.0
90,White Is Relic/Irrealis Mood,['Of Montreal'],"Citing influences from DJ Screw to James Baldwin, Kevin Barnes’ latest is a maximalist dance party about our simulated realities.
Did you hear the one about how reality is an illusion and what we think of as “human life” and “the universe” are just lines of code in some superior being’s cosmic computer simulation? Although it has the ring of stoner mysticism, simulated reality is an actual theory that scientists and philosophers have seriously entertained. At a debate on the subject a couple of years ago, moderator Neil deGrasse Tyson confessed, “It is easy for me to imagine that everything in our lives is just a creation of some other entity for their entertainment.” The theory gained currency, for obvious reasons, after Brexit, the 2016 election, and the odd best picture mix-up at last year’s Oscars.
It also made quite the impression on Of Montreal mastermind Kevin Barnes, who cites months of Trump-related “simulated reality paranoid” as a chief influence on his new album, White Is Relic/Irrealis Mood. On the chorus of the best track, “Plateau Phase/No Careerism No Corruption,” he suggests that what we think of as reality is so fragile and fluid that, “If we put our ear to the ceiling, we can hear the multiverse seeding, we can hear the simulation wheezing.”
Not that Barnes—a maximalist in all things, from songwriting to character creation to performance style—could ever confine himself to a single inspiration. For more than a decade, he’s been documenting his emotional crises on Of Montreal albums that double as catalogs of his recent obsessions. Along with referencing Germaine Greer, James Salter, and classic European art films like Valerie and Her Week of Wonders, Barnes increasingly conceives each LP as a genre study. False Priest, from 2010, was his Prince-inspired foray into plastic funk. His most recent album, 2016’s Innocence Reaches, filtered contemporary EDM sounds and internet/social justice jargon through vintage synthesizers. Now, each almost-yearly release plays like a new season of an ongoing Kevin Barnes anthology series; the styles, characters, and themes change, but the auteurist creator and his intellectual voracity remain the same.
With White Is Relic, Danceteria season approaches. Barnes includes a list of influences that features ’80s-era extended club mixes, the late chopped-and-screwed pioneer DJ Screw, and the colorful gender fuckery of films by Pedro Almodóvar. On a personal level, Barnes says he’s finally forgiven himself for the failure of his well-documented marriage to former bandmate Nina Aimee Grøttland and fallen in love again. But it’s simulated reality that makes these apparently unrelated sounds and ideas hang together, in one of the most cohesive Of Montreal albums since their 2007 masterpiece, Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?
It’s to Barnes’ credit that, despite his experimentation, every song he records has his stamp—those churning melodies, the faintly androgynous vocals, the comically vast lyrical vocabulary. Still, White Is Relic goes a step beyond even his recent genre studies, stretching the typical four-minute Of Montreal single so that only six tracks fill its 41-minute runtime. Punctuated by fluttery horns and synths that recall zippers on nylon, the long instrumental passages really do give the impression that Barnes has remixed his own compositions.
Cribbing from DJ Screw, Barnes often slows down just one element of a song, creating the spooky sensation that it’s playing in two different dimensions at once. In the outro to “Paranoiac Intervals/Body Dysmorphia,” his vocals are pulled thin like taffy over increasingly arpeggiated drum beats. “Body dysmorphia, I know how it feels,” he chants, as the music translates that perceptual distortion into aural terms. The overall impression is of some outside force—perhaps an alien species with next-level programming skills and a sick sense of humor—adjusting each track as it plays. In fact, Barnes did compose the album as a sort of disembodied intelligence, incorporating the contributions of remote collaborators instead of gathering a band in the studio.
If Kevin Barnes the songwriter is playing god, then Kevin Barnes the singer is all too human, a digital ant like everyone else desperate to stay sane in this darkest computer-simulated timeline. Love is one source of transcendence. It gives us a glimpse of the dirty-minded, late-’00s Of Montreal on “Sophie Calle Private Game/Every Person Is a Pussy, Every Pussy Is a Star!,” a mid-tempo sex jam that name-drops Sappho and recounts all-night Almodóvar binges, alongside erotically asphyxiated saxophones.
Like so many of us fragile aesthetes, Barnes has spent the past two years looking to political art for inspiration to resist America’s new dystopian regime. That’s where he channels the work of Angela Davis, Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Baldwin, as well as the words “white is relic,” for better and worse. On the ghostly “Writing the Circles/Orgone Tropics,” the compulsively self-dramatizing singer seems to be chiding himself with the observation, “This acute loneliness that you feel has nothing to do with other people.” But even if your tolerance for white artists discovering racism two decades into their career is high, it’s sure to be tested by some of Barnes’ more self-indulgent lyrics. The dreamy opening track “Soft Music/Juno Portraits of the Jovian Sky” finds him complaining, “Soft music drains the oxygen from besieged Bushwick streets reflexively retching Anglo influx” and resolving that “there will be no gentrificating our graffitied warship of summer love.”
It’s easy to miss the album’s sonic and conceptual ingenuity amid the lyrical bloat. The thing is, even Barnes’ worst clunkers serve a purpose. When they give way to one of the devastatingly plainspoken lines he’s also capable of writing—“It’s good for us depressives to keep someone else alive” on “Sophie Calle,” for example—it’s like he’s lifting a curtain to reveal a shaft of midday sunlight. Whether that blackout shade is Kevin Barnes’ tortured psyche, America in 2018, or our entire, allegedly simulated universe, everything is briefly, brilliantly illuminated when White Is Relic pulls it back.",2018-03-13T05:00:00,['Rock'],7.2,Polyvinyl,Of Montreal: White Is Relic/Irrealis Mood Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/of-montreal-white-is-relicirrealis-mood/,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2018-03-13,6.445205479452055,2018.0,0.0
91,Polysics or Die!!!,['Polysics'],"Japanese new wave fans release a mix of catalog songs and new recordings.
Tokyo's Polysics must know their Japanese take on Devo could sound ridiculous, so they cut out the sardonic middleman and simply lampoon themselves. Their matching jumpsuits and space-age specs are brilliantly meta, not to mention the egregious shoutouts to new wave influences. Polysics or Die!!!, a greatest hits compilation of sorts-- and Polysics's first release since leaving Asian Man Records-- sports titles like ""New Wave Jacket"", ""Eno"", the not-so-veiled ""XCT"", and a cover of ""My Sharona"". However, the Polysics' obsession with a certain Akron, Ohio five-piece permeates this collection. Not only do they boast the craziest synth, surf guitar, robo-beat and spastic vocals combo since Freedom of Choice, but everything's accelerated for current listeners' frenetic, DDR-paced attention spans.
California-based Tofu, a label specializing in exposing unsung Japanese acts to the States, picks up on this connection and by re-recording five of Polysics' best songs for the album, they make a concerted attempt to pique the Nintendo demographic. Usually these re-recordings simply improve the lo-fi Asian Man takes, but the difference is considerable. The matador-inspired chromatic chords of ""Buggie Techinica"" get the arena treatment, sounding even larger and more grandiose than the Hey! Bob! My Friend! version. ""Hot Stuff"" also benefits by harder rocking production, its chunky bassline and yelping vocals no longer sounding as though recorded from a boom box.
At the time of their release, each Polysics album has appeared to be ""the big one,"" the record that endears Americans to these goofy homages to new wave nerd rock. Unfortunately, Hey! Bob! My Friend! and Neu, both adored by critics, have barely registered in even the most open-minded indie rock circles, and there's little reason to think this compilation will buck that trend. Perhaps the video game beeps and glitches seem too tacky, or the sugary Japanese vocals too kiddy, or the audacious album title too cocksure compared to today's modest, pretend-like-you-don't-give-a-fuck bands, but this band actually deserves those three exclamation points.",2005-04-18T05:00:03,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",8.2,Tofu,Polysics: Polysics or Die!!!

92,Crack,['Z-Ro'],"Busy Houston MC's sixth Rap-A-Lot offering sounds drab and more than a little lonely; guests include Slim Thug and Paul Wall.
Foreclosure is nipping at hip-hop's heels. Though it doesn't look it thanks to a broad, impressive list of releases from this and last year-- led by, in no specific order, Bun B's crowd-pleasing II Trill, Trae's wrenching Life Goes On, Devin the Dude's uncanny Waiting to Inhale and Scarface's lion-in-winter MADE-- even Houston's once evergreen Rap-A-Lot records is a house going to seed. Trae left the label in May. Devin has fled too, and already dropped a new full-length disc-- with Razor & Tie of all places.
For Z-Ro, who first appeared in the corners of DJ Screw's chain of drizzling, endless mid-1990s classics (most of which are now conveniently repackaged and available at your nearest Best Buy-- start with the 3xCD June 27), and has released five albums already on Rap-A-Lot, the whole world is starting to sound like it's closing up shop. Case in point is Z-Ro's sixth on Rap-A-Lot, Crack, which is drab, shabby and more than a little lonely (""I smoke purple stuff alone in my room""). It can't make its terrain of solipsistic gangsters and Houston beltway-sulk hum with emotion or its layers of horns and hi-hats shake with any color.
Z-Ro produces eight of the album's 15 tracks, and leans on heaps of previous compositions. The raided discs include the last two Trae albums and Trae and Z-Ro's two collaborations, 2003's A.B.N (Assholes by Nature) and this summer's downpour of noir, It Is What It Is. The samples are all tamped down and strip-mined in their reincarnations on Crack. ""Here We Go"" features an inexplicable pan flute and a lifeless snare. The would-be ladies-jam ""Baby Girl"" reeks with clumps of digital sparkle and hubby-talk: ""She follow my lead/ And respect the fact that I wear the pants.""
Z-Ro's hook is that the intimacy in his raps-- perpetually commemorating a handful of dead collaborators and friends, worshiping solitude and seemingly dismissing all worldly pleasures (except, of course, kush, candy paint, and lean)-- dips into weakness. On Crack he scoffs at dancing on ""If That's How You Feel"": ""My body don't move like that, so Im'a chill/ Im'a play the wall, leaving all to dancing to y'all."" He'd prefer it if no one called and no one spoke; four wheels are typically all the company he needs.
But for all his confession Z-Ro brushes his breakthroughs aside. As soon has he resonates with real sentiment-- on divorce: ""I don't give a fuck as long as my child knows me""-- the album swoops back into dropsied howls about those suspicious club hos and these disrespectful young corner boys. Where, say, Scarface, may hold a mournful note for an extra beat, Z-Ro instantly flips into a stream of pithy taunts and complaints. The effect is dulling, frustrating, and more than a little repulsive.
Z-Ro at least had his strengths catered to on 2005's Let the Truth Be Told. There, the underrated long-time Scarface producer Mike Dean laid out a chain of warmer, blues-inflected guitar and drum loops for Z-Ro's moans. Dean is totally absent from Crack and other veteran Houston producers like Mr. Lee can't summon any suitable nostalgia, which makes Z-Ro seem even more alone. All the shining lights of the Houston scene sport something ineffable: Scarface's transcendent violence; Devin's beat-poet-leer; Trae's whorls of emotional concision; Big Moe's druggy, violet sunshine. Z-Ro has always been satisfied playing the brassy, noncommittal grump. That's a fine enough role to play, but as the world around him downsizes and constricts, he's clamming up, retreating home and phoning it in.",2008-11-17T06:00:05,['Rap'],4.7,Rap-A-Lot,Z-Ro: Crack Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12430-crack/,reviews/albums,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2008-11-17,-2.878082191780822,2008.75,0.0
93,The Things That We Are Made Of,['Mary Chapin Carpenter'],"Mary Chapin Carpenter's lean and haunting songs often sound best when they're given room to breathe. The production here by David Cobb (Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson) is just the ticket.
“What to Keep and What to Throw Away,” a key song from Mary Chapin Carpenter’s 2012 album Ashes and Roses, tells the story of a recent divorcee sorting through her ex-husband’s belongings. With its sparse, second-person narrative and hushed fingerpicking, it plays something like a passage from Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking put to music. Heard in the context of Carpenter’s remarkable recent work, this song is perhaps her defining track: a propulsive series of quiet thoughts expressed with a novelistic eye for detail in her immaculate, articulate whisper. But it also feels like a mission statement.
Just like the narrator of “What to Keep and What to Throw Away,” Carpenter followed Ashes and Roses by taking stock of her own career, reimagining some of her finest compositions backed by a symphony orchestra. Songs from the Movie from 2014 was a pleasant enough album but, like Joni Mitchell’s similarly-minded Travelogue, it couldn’t help but feel like an epilogue: the kind of statement an artist makes once she’s said everything she set out to say. That album’s sense of finality may be partly why the arrival of The Things That We Are Made Of—Carpenter’s 14th album and her first produced by David Cobb (Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton)—feels like such a pleasant surprise.
Cobb’s sparse, raw production is a welcome change of pace for Carpenter, an artist whose lush, country-leaning work has often slipped comfortably into adult contemporary radio, belying her characteristically complex songwriting. On Things, Cobb knows exactly how to complement Carpenter’s work to make her music sound as urgent and intimate as her lyrics. The minimal electric guitars that linger in the background of “The Middle Ages” are sparse and haunting, while “What Does It Mean to Travel” floats with a spacey Ghosts of the Great Highway weariness. Single and centerpiece “Map of My Heart,” meanwhile, is the jauntiest song Carpenter has put her name to since the ’90s and serves as a reminder of just how influential her particular intonations have been for today’s crop of country-pop crossovers.
It is in this song that Carpenter summarizes the theme of the album in two crucial lines: “I learned how to travel/Just what I can carry.” From the literal journey at the heart of “Livingston” to the more symbolic one in “Deep Deep Down Heart,” nearly every song on Things is tied to the road, giving the album the feel of a long, lonely late night drive. Like many long drives, however, this one gets a little dreary near the end: “Note on a Windshield” tries and fails to transcend the banality of its central metaphor, while the closing title track aims for hymnal and lands closer to lullaby.
The album does itself no favors by stacking all of its most exciting moments at the beginning, and crowding the five-minute ballads together at the end. Still, these are small concerns for a record whose very presence feels like a refreshing return to action. With 11 songs in just under one hour, Things is Carpenter’s briefest collection of new material in over a decade and serves as a fine entry point for newcomers. It is not her most revelatory work, but it is a strong, concise statement from an artist moving more swiftly and confidently than ever—carrying only what is absolutely necessary, and leaving the rest behind.",2016-05-11T05:00:00,['Folk/Country'],6.8,Lambent Light,Mary Chapin Carpenter: The Things That We Are Made Of Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21878-the-things-that-we-are-made-of/,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2016-05-11,4.6068493150684935,2016.25,0.0
94,Darlings,['Kevin Drew'],"In comparison to 2007's Spirit If..., the Broken Social Scene leader's second solo album doesn't feel like the work of a band. Synth-heavy and prone to slow-building torch songs, Darlings turns out to be a fine showcase for Drew's expressive voice and distinctive obsessions.
Kevin Drew would make a great poet laureate under Toronto’s current regime, but unfortunately the guy in charge seems like more of a hip-hop fan. For the past decade, Drew’s work as a solo artist and with Broken Social Scene has dealt in sex, drugs, politics, and the politics of druggy sex, and though he’s clearly been deposed as the T. Dot’s resident superfreak, Darlings finds him going down swinging. Here are three of its first four songs: “Body Butter”; “Good Sex”; “Mexican Aftershow Party”. And those titles are not placeholders—more like truth in advertising, headlines teasing stories about Drew after dark.
As with the most recent record by Brendan Canning, the “Broken Social Scene Presents…” appellation has been dropped from Drew’s second go-round. Once it made sense. *Spirit If…*from 2007 was basically a Drew-centric Broken Social Scene album—shaggy and communal, it served as a passageway between Broken Social Scene and Forgiveness Rock Record. Darlings—sometimes orchestral, and prone to slow-burning torch songs—never feels like a “band” record. That’s partly due to the synth-heavy arrangements, where guitars play only a supporting role. The electronics don’t make Darlings a particularly modernist record, but the album does have a strange timeliness. As with the most recent releases from Jim James, Devendra Banhart, Volcano Choir, and Wild Beasts, there seems to be a trend of aging men gravitating towards a sound where guitars no longer convey their inner lusts and desires.
Still, you wouldn’t call it “synth-pop,” any more than you would Bruce Springsteen’s Tunnel of Love, an album that serves as a spiritual forebear for albums like Darlings.* Its more muted character makes a case for Drew as one of indie rock’s most subtly distinctive vocalists. His tone doesn’t lend itself to descriptive terms, but four years after Forgiveness Rock Record,* it’s striking how instantly familiar Drew can sound even in this newly sleek context, thanks to a cadence that riffs on ragged melodies just a little behind the beat.
This works in Darlings’ favor, particularly when Drew’s voice is all you can hang onto. He has a knack for lyrics that are both explicit and obtuse, words that are overly blunt and vague at the same time. “You Gotta Feel It” and “You Got Caught” both repeat a stock phrase ad nauseam to bind ambiguous lines, while “Bullshit Ballad” is every bit the empty salvo it criticizes. The latter’s steady chug bears a striking resemblance to Arcade Fire’s “Keep the Car Running”, though I doubt it’s aimed in their direction. More likely, it’s aimed at no one in particular, and the non-specificity of lines like “Your soul was distracted/ And your vocals were too high…your horrible whining” renders it the only time where Darlings is well, pretty limp.
But “Bullshit Ballad” is more of a curious fit than a weak song; the rest of Darlings lays out what Drew considers to be ballads free of bullshit. The album is often just as expansive as Broken Social Scene, though spreading outwards rather than shooting upwards and collapsing—its struggles are wholly internal rather than external. On “Body Butter”, Drew wants to party all alone, and yet he allows his date to the Mexican aftershow party to claim him as hers only because “I don’t wanna fight with the man that I am.” You get a good sense of just what kind of man Drew is on Darlings, reconciling monogamy with promiscuity, Broken Social Scene’s cheap-seats bombast with love-seat confidentiality.",2014-03-19T06:00:00,"['Experimental', 'Rock']",7.6,Arts & Crafts,Kevin Drew: Darlings Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19114-kevin-drew-darlings/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2014-03-19,2.458904109589041,2014.0,0.0
95,Maxo 187,['Maxo Kream'],"Houston rapper Maxo Kream borrows heavily from outsider visions of his own city, blending the local Houston and the more panoramic, now global idea of Houston and seeking a middle ground between the city’s perception and its reality.
Houston’s rap scene—or more specifically, its aesthetic—has been ravaged by outsiders. The biggest appropriators, like Harlem’s A$AP Mob and Miami’s Raider Klan, have repurposed the sounds of DJ Screw and the lingo of UGK into a sort of chopped-and-screwed noir. It’s a haunting take on trill culture that sucks out most of the funk, leaving only distorted vocals and waves of ambience. Houston up-and-comer Maxo Kream is taking heed of the poachers and embracing their renditions of Houston rap and culture. He isn’t interested in reclaiming the city from squatters; in fact, he’s more than willing to play by their rules, and on Maxo 187 he seeks a middle ground between the city’s perception and its reality.
The record is a sinister and visceral portrait of Houston street life that binges heavily on the A$AP brand of trill, even enlisting one of its producers (A$AP P on the Boards). The music is a binary of local Houston and the more panoramic, now global idea of Houston, which spawned the #BEENTRILL movement and the widespread abuse of lean. Kream's sound is far more derivative of the A$AP crew than Z-Ro, but his music is still deeply indebted to Houston gang culture. The music is most menacing when Kream drapes his gangland tales over creeping synth progressions and pulsating bass lines reminiscent of Spaceghostpurrp’s ""Pheel tha Phonk 1990"".
Kream has been completely indoctrinated by gang culture, and on songs like ""Thirteen"" and ""KKK"" his raps are imbued with the rhetoric. At times, it’s borderline propaganda: On ""Paranoia"", which is produced by A$AP P on the Boards, he raps remorselessly about killing civilians and decapitating grandmothers for some sort of greater good (""Fuck your opinion I’m just trying to make a living""). It's chilling, in part because he doesn't even sound like he's trying to convince anyone that what he’s doing is worth it. Maxo 187 doesn’t portray cripping as an escape from the hood but a liberation from ordinary life.
The lyrics are peppered with occasionally complex ideas exposing the corrosive nature of gangs, and Kream softens these ideas with accessible metaphors. When he finds the right balance between the two, his wordplay clicks. ""My boys goin' pop I ain’t talkin' Backstreet/ My guns goin' pop and the bullets in sync,"" he raps on ""1998"", laying the groundwork for a personal flashback to the year in question. Most of his more engaging rapping takes place when he avoids talk of homicide altogether. The Father-assisted ""Cell Boomin"" and dual-sided ""Trap Mami / Flippin"", both produced by Houston beatsmith Wxlf Gxd, are drug peddler anthems with bouncing flows that explore static thump and a syrupy codeine haze.
A year ago, Maxo Kream told Noisey that he felt the candy-coated Houston sound was dated and that it was time to welcome the city’s new image. His message was clear: The city has changed, so its sound should change with it. However, Kream has tethered himself to the A$AP interpretation of Houston rap and the music he’s making now is heavily shaped by the outside perception of his city, the reappropriation of Screw into something even more ominous. Though Kream maintains his ties to Houston street life, he continues to find himself in the reflection of those that have been pantomiming H-Town rappers for years now instead of those within the city limits.",2015-03-19T06:00:04,['Rap'],6.6,TSO,Maxo Kream: Maxo 187 Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20356-maxo-187/,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2015-03-19,3.458904109589041,2015.0,0.0
96,Warm Blanket,['Dent May'],"On Warm Blanket, the singer-songwriter revisits his familiar mundane themes with fuller orchestrations, showing a debt to and admiration of Brian Wilson is more prominent than ever. But he runs into some long-standing problems when it comes to actually saying something in his songs.
Dent May's songs really work in the context of his label, Animal Collective's Paw Tracks. He comes off as the inverse of lablemate Ariel Pink's narcotic AM kaleidoscopes: a button-up, FM-obsessive who just has his shit a little more together. In the context of a boutique label like Paw Tracks -- with Black Dice, Eric Copeland, and Excepter on the roster -- May is the palate cleanser, the fresh drink of sweet lemonade after a cocktail of Campari and motor oil. Maybe at Paw Tracks luncheons he’s the odd man out, where the other noiseniks are sharing an experimental demo tape recorded with a vintage arpeggiator in a large field, Dent May is pacing around humming a pop melody with his hands in his pockets, thinking about where he last had his keys.
Considering that Dent May obsesses over the banalities of love in his songs, that fantasy really isn’t a stretch. Last year’s LP Do Things saw him doing the kind of unremarkable things best suited for the notes in the margin in the book of summer-- breezy songs filled with platitudes about young love and the woes of paying rent. On Warm Blanket, May revisits many of the same themes that he did just over a year ago, only with fuller orchestrations, and a partial explanation for his love of the mundane. His debt to and admiration of Brian Wilson is more prominent than ever, sounding almost like he had Murray Wilson in the studio with him cracking the whip and tightening the harmonies to make each melody as sticky as possible. The problem is Dent May -- the one-man band who wrote, arranged, and performed the bulk of this album -- is not only still not doing things, but he’s not really saying things, either.
May’s main worry on Warm Blanket is this idea that he is living in the wrong era. The album’s thesis is presented in “Born Too Late”, where May cascades down a chorus singing “Born too late to tell you that I love you baby/ But I want you to know I been thinkin’ about you lately.” It’s a sweet tune, one of the best he’s ever written, and it sticks around longer that it has any right too. Similar is “Ready to Be Old”, where we get a hint of May’s malaise: “I think the future will feel much better than I feel now.” His dissatisfaction with the present informs his songwriting, born ceaselessly into the past with lyrics that could be anything from schoolyard love-notes to something that could've been crooned by Bing Crosby. Wit, irony, satire mostly elude May across the album-- instead there are 11 songs of bedroom-surf rock that are so bizarrely simple they become ingratiating.
Maybe that’s May’s goal: to shine a light on efficacy of simplicity in the face of the complexities of modern life. The syncopated way he sings the chorus of of “Summer Is Over” that borrows from the Beach Boys wholesale doesn’t require any subtext or cleverness. Maybe its May’s exhaustion with the layers of 21st century communication that pushes him to use colorless nouns and tropey turns of phrase to write songs, like ""So let them hate us/ 'cause we're not haters"" on ""Let Them Talk"". Whatever the case, his hooks get stuck in your head but his lyrics are thin and forgettable. If May’s prolific pace and knack for a hook continues into next year, he could afford to be a bit more May Schmay and a little less ""Dent May Sings Of Mixed-Up Hearts"".",2013-08-26T06:00:01,['Rock'],6.2,Paw Tracks,Dent May: Warm Blanket Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18385-dent-may-warm-blanket/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2013-08-26,1.8972602739726028,2013.5,0.0
97,We Are the Champions,['JEFF the Brotherhood'],"Former Be Your Own Pet members add shades of Weezer-like power-pop to their economy-sized psych-rock.
Nashville's JEFF the Brotherhood are two brothers, Jamin and Jake Orrall. One's on guitar and vocals; the other mans the drums. They also co-run Infinity Cat Recordings with their father, singer/songwriter Robert Ellis Orrall, the only man in the world that can say he wrote songs for Shenandoah and Lindsay Lohan. JEFF's been an ongoing concern since 2002, but the brothers Orrall have logged time in plenty of bands, including the earliest incarnation of Be Your Own Pet. Like Pet, JEFF was fond of the fuzzy spastic two-to-three-minute punk-pop tune, but they were also fond of being unpredictable. Jamin and Jake were just as likely to say their peace in 30 seconds as they were to stretch things out for 14 minutes.
After numerous tours and releases, 2009's Heavy Days saw the Orralls focusing their powers and presenting themselves as an economy-sized psych-rock outfit, an Eagles of Death Metal with one less mouth to feed and a lot more pot in the glove compartment. Big and heavy but still quick on its feet, Heavy Days was a step forward that could please both longtime fans and those new to the party.
That said, anyone who's been tracking the moves the Orralls have made might be thrown off a bit by the way We Are the Champions kicks off, and I'm not talking about the rap-radio-exclusive airhorn that sounds off at the start of ""Hey Friend"". It's the song proper, and its remarkable similarity to what good Weezer sounds like, which might surprise. Everything about the tune-- its loping mid-tempo cadence, Jake Orrall's Cuomo-like vocals, even the tune's simple-simon sentiments (""I've been thinking about your mom/ You can tell me if it's really wrong"")-- makes it sound like a Weezer Blue Album demo. Some might see that as a step backwards for JEFF, but I mean that comparison as a complement. The tune's aw-shucks silliness is as charming as its earworm of a melody is inescapable.
There's a fair amount of Heavy Days' brand of amp damage to be found on Champions-- you'll want to skip to ""Cool Out"" or ""Ripper"" to get that fix-- and one sitar-flecked tune (""Health and Strength"") that'd fit right in on a Thee Oh Sees album, but the aforementioned poppier M.O. is the way the majority of this album goes. ""Bummer"" was JEFF's contribution to a split single with Best Coast, but plenty of tunes from Champions, from the gently rumbling ""Diamond Way"" to the awkwardly confident ""Wastoid Girl"", could stand toe-to-toe with anything Best Coast had to offer. It's only fitting that this album signals the beginning of a business partnership between Infinity Cat and the Warner Music Group. We Are the Champions might disappoint some diehard fans, but it's also proof positive that JEFF the Brotherhood can play with the big boys.",2011-05-20T06:00:02,['Rock'],7.3,Infinity Cat Recordings,JEFF the Brotherhood: We Are the Champions Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15452-we-are-the-champions/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2011-05-20,-0.37397260273972605,2011.25,0.0
98,No Silver/No Gold,['Baptist Generals'],"The barn's empty and sinking. You see the sky through pauses in the roof; otherwise the wind's muffled ...
The barn's empty and sinking. You see the sky through pauses in the roof; otherwise the wind's muffled. There's bird shit everywhere, and you begin gathering it with your feet into a single pile. You notice that when shit mixes with dust it looks like flour on wet dough. Next you recline across two rusted lawn chairs, unwinding. You sip lemon water and listen to the sky for airplanes taking off and landing: they follow twisting plots, surprising arcs, and pause where they can, rest a while, ascend. Then there's a sound you thought existed only at night in the suburbs, when it's completely still and all you can hear is the hum of the freeway in the distance.
My friend has a theory of non-perfect beauty. In her mind, it's worth getting obsessed over uneven teeth, weak coffee in roadside cafes, unintentionally lopsided bangs, sweaters with holes held together by safety pins. The above, I guess, is my application of her theory, but it's also a response to the Baptist Generals, a band who embodies broke-ass gorgeousness in the form of a rowdy soul-sickness not easy to fake. In the world of these four weary Denton, TX guys who buy their equipment at pawnshops, people want things so badly they chase after them until their feet are bloody stumps. Or they pack their one bag then forget to run at all, as if mired deep to the knees in a Southern Gothic dream.
The Baptist Generals have been recording in one form or another since 1998. No Silver/No Gold, their debut LP for Sub Pop, is hinged together with a claustrophobic insularity I remember detailed so fully on The Grifters' brilliant One Sock Missing, and rarely after that. The music is fragile and spiritual, sodden and boisterous. It's as if the players are seeking out loosely sewn faultlines while trying to balance decay and redemption and to escape a permanent rupture in either direction.
Recorded on an eight-track in someone's garage, the album begins sparely with ""Ay Distress"", a hobo spiritual showcasing Chris Flemmons' cracked-up voice. His is the pained screech of an outsider, one who seemingly doesn't give a fuck about hitting notes, who instead plows around, and through his bastardized ABC's, still somehow gets the thing right, wrapping every fragment in a godly mist of tangled, slipshod estrangement. While reminiscent of the chirping yowls of Refrigerator's Allen Callaci, the closest analogue is Roky Erickson's post-breakdown solo recordings. And that's high praise.
""Ay Distress"" shares the 3:00 a.m. bedroom vibe of Refrigerator's ""One of Everything"", the lovely opener on 1996's Anchors of Bleed. Here, in Flemmons' calloused hands, it's a lullaby to one who continually misses the song in their heart. Flemmons nails the words as they fall and spit and piss around him, but when he reaches the near-end of the rhyme, his cellphone starts singing, too. This interruption breaks the spell, pushing him into a series of real-life histrionics: extremely frustrated shouts of 'goddamn it' and 'oh-h-h-h god' (I imagine him rolling his eyes to an empty heaven). And then he throws the phone or some other inanimate junk and finally, before the tape's cut, he smashes himself against a door. Though it isn't the best way to end a lullaby, the next track, ""Alcohol (Turn & Fall)"", offers a solution for falling asleep when large men are tossing themselves against walls around you: turn off the light, get drunk, sweat it out.
There are so many good songs here, and each is difficult to recount by quoting lyrics or offering descriptions of certain elements. Though it's Flemmons' croon that strikes you initially, the band playing with him is equally dead-on: guitars sound like they're being snapped, the drums are shaggy-dog and really fuzzy. There seem to be buzzsaws, and the keyboards, slide guitar, and theremin are always somewhere in the distance catching breaths before chiming loudly into the general mess. The songs threaten to blow out your speakers purely with melancholy and anger.
The Baptist Generals seem to know you can't ever really return to some cleaned-up state. And, really, most of us are too poor to afford simulated perfection anyhow. So you learn to deal with your injuries, make sure they're accounted for, and if you're lucky then you find some powerful and pure way to express the things that are most fucked.",2003-04-03T06:00:02,"['Electronic', 'Rock']",8.5,Sub Pop,Baptist Generals: No Silver/No Gold Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11661-no-silverno-gold/,reviews/albums,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2003-04-03,-8.508219178082191,2003.25,0.0

The music biz being what it is, Orchestra Baobab never quite got their due in the West. They disbanded in the mid-1980s, just as more and more people were growing aware that there was music being released all over the world, some of it-– gasp!-– not even in English. Still, the Senegalese group had it better than most. During their initial run, at least, Orchestra Baobab ruled West African pop, and their impact and influence were such the group eventually reconvened, at last getting the star treatment not just locally but around the globe.
Orchestra Baobab's aptly titled 2002 comeback disc, Specialist in All Styles, encapsulated many of the ever-evolving group's strengths, in particular their knack for musical assimilation. Equally informed by Cuban and indigenous African musics, not to mention hybrids like Congolese rumba and Senegal's own pop strain mbalax, the disc found them picking up where they left off. Six years later, Made in Dakar continues the voyage with still more seamless style blending. Of course, nothing here is as crass as, say, rap-metal. Orchestra Baobab's fusion is far more subtle, and always rooted in traditional music. While world music elitists might prefer their sounds obscure, exotic, and mysterious, Orchestra Baobab is so smooth, so deceptively accessible, that for once the liner notes actually significantly enhance the listening experience.
We learn that the lead track, ""Pape Ndiaye"", stretches back to 1968, and marked one of the first modern updatings of a traditional griot song. We see that ""Nijaay"" was first performed by Baobab back in 1972; the version here features a cameo from Youssou N'Dour, whose own stardom eventually came to eclipse Baobab. ""Beni Baraale"" is a tribute to Guinea's equally groundbreaking Bembeya Jazz; Guinea guitarist Baba Nabe joins Baobab guitarist Barthélemy Attisso in what amounts to a tip of the hat by way of ethno-musicology.
Each song here-- with vocals performed in Wolof, Portuguese Creole, French, and Malinke-- is equally rich in history, testament to one of the few positive outcomes of European occupation as they deftly incorporate soul and salsa, rumba and jazz, reggae and country, an exercise in cross-pollination made all the more impressive by the near invisibility of the threads connecting it all. That's ultimately what makes Orchestra Baobab such a joy: It's dance music, pure and simple, made for others to have a good time, easily appreciated on the basis of its musicianship alone (Attisso is particularly inspired throughout) but becoming more impressive the deeper you dig into what's actually being done.",2008-06-18T06:00:03,['Global'],7.6,Unknown,Orchestra Baobab: Made in Dakar Album Review | Pitchfork,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11595-made-in-dakar/,reviews/albums,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2008-06-18,-3.2945205479452055,2008.25,0.0
